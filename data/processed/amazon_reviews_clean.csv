"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.",5.0,B00QJDU3KY,1,i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyage fortunately i had friends who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both models now have ppi so the dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage s page press isn t always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you don t need auto light adjustment it s been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regrets the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case it s not hard to change the setting either as you ll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while reading also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery was on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about customs which i may have if i used a third party shipping service
"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy.

I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long.

"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more",5.0,B00QJDU3KY,1,i bought one of the first paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and i suppose ive read on average a book every three days for the past however many years on it i wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers for sundry logistical reasons ive also made good use of amazons kindle app on my iphone no paperwhite screen naturally and all the cool usability that delivers but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the kindle of course there are aspects of the paperwhite which i would like to critique ah you knew that was coming somewhere didnt you as a member of bookbub i get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres i take on many of them however ive found that even with the best will in the world i cant keep up some days it seems that for every book i read ive bought two theres just so much good stuff out there the accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time its now at about with this in mind ive noticed that while page turning has remained exactly the same just about every other action on the kindle has become positively glacial not just very slow but so slow you think its malfunctioning the general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a kindle it will begin to behave in a flakey manner this drives me mad amazon states it can hold thousands of books i believe them but i figure i would need a second paperwhite to read while im waiting for actions to complete on the first one read more
"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it.",5.0,B00QJDU3KY,1,i have to say upfront i don t like coroporate hermetically closed stuff like anything by apple or in this case amazon i like having devices on which i can put anything i want and use it but i was a fairly happy user of a nook touch for several years but couldn t use all its functionalities since i live in serbia then i lost the nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in serbia buying books with them using their online capabilities except the kindle and since no one except amazon ships to serbia and since i ve actually been a happy amazon customer since over friends accounts and since through my own and since the kindle definitely has the best technology why not buy itso i did what i read in many reviews about the screen light of the paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine the light disperses just fine except a few black blotches maybe you can see it in the picture at the bottom of the screen which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can t really be avoided as you can see in the picture without the light there are no blotches with light out the paperwhite s screen is just marvelous at ppi the touchscreen works just fine the store works here in serbia and in these two days i ve been using it i m a happy guy i had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like amazon books but that s fine that s the one thing i d like to see amazon do in some future upgrades make the kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly with sharing funcion quotes and goodreads enabled and so on the size is perfect it sits very well in the hand the light doesn t hurt the eyes in the dark like the light on a tab does the packaging was fine no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life so far i can only recommend it

"This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes.

Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.",5.0,B00QJDU3KY,1,this is a review of the kindle paperwhite launched july essentially the

"I love my kindle! I got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so I decided to get one for myself as well and I am glad I did. It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores.",5.0,B00QJDU3KY,1,i love my kindle i got one for my fiance on his birthday he loved it so i decided to get one for myself as well and i am glad i did it is very easy to read books in it i love the dictionary on this little device normally i just skip a word i don t know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle i just press and hold my finger on the word i don t know and translation pops up so essentially the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips if you love to read books i highly recommend kindle however if you only read manga or comic books if you are a fan of buying how to draw how to sew books i do not recommend kindle for you it is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides so if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now if you are a manga fan just buy your manga books from bookstores

"Only 4 stars because I found it very confusing at first. I had a Kindle before found it very easy to find what I needed to do. The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. At first I wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. I'm sure I'm just a creature of habit not very techy.

"I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round.",5.0,B00QJDU3KY,1,i already had an original kindle paperwhite and loved it buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but i am so pleased i made this move i love the new font and the clarity of the screen i love that the kindle comes to life when i open the cover i bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp while there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel i have made a great purchase which i am happy with i also have a bunch of books from my amazon co uk site which i access on my old kindle i couldn t work out how if at all i can move books from one amazon jurisdiction to another so this has proved a good purchase all round

"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges).

"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",5.0,B002Y27P3M,1,update november my review is now over a year old as is the kindle keyboard as amazon calls it now there are newer models the basic cheapie kindle and the kindle touch and of course the kindle fire quasi tablet each of these models is an excellent choice whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences the e ink kindles are kindle keyboard this one kindle touch the newest flagship model and the basic kindle all of them have exactly the same display with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain the kindle keyboard is the oldest of these models and i got one of the first ones when they came out in august i still absolutely love my kindle keyboard and use it almost every day i have read dozens of books on it i like the newer models they have some neat features but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my year old kindle keyboard page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest kindles but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading in my opinion the touch screen interface of the kindle touch is pretty neat but unlike my ipad i only use my kindle to read books and reading books is just as nice on any of the current kindle models i don t consider the touch screen a must have feature and i m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product i own for that reason i think the cheapest kindle is an excellent choice read more
"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job.

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently.

The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV.

"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more.

"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",5.0,B00DU15MU4,1,i m your typical middle aged woman i don t game and i m not super tech savvy by any means so take this review for what it is the fire tv was easy to install and i m loving all the features free movies music and simple interface this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you re listening to music we ve always just had our comcast cable service without dvr and occasionally used comcast ondemand to watch rent movies but i ll never watch from comcast again the voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what i was looking for every single time i searched it s just so easy to find what you re looking for unlike comcast and since i m an amazon prime member most of what i want to view is free oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from amazon is on average cheaper than comcast ondemand by a or more so happy with this purchase

"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded.

"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",5.0,B01LW1MS9C,1,i am thoroughly impressed with my echo dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop the construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the echo this case cover will give your echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in but still offer the great functionality of alexa

"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen.

This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options.

"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",4.0,B01FWSVGQQ,1,i am updating my review from two months ago my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review i originally did not recommend this product but after living with it and growing to like it i am changing my recommendation the truth is the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall also it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock but it isn t as big of a problem as i thought it would be i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it leaving the top of the sling on easy off and easy back on after my only real lingering complaint would be the price for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive i am increasing my stars by one really the price is the only thing keeping this from a star for me i have come to really like the sling i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean safe while throwing it into a work bag my original is below overall i would and have recommended the sling to protect the tap received the tap and the sling cover in the last hours read more
"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it..

"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",5.0,B01FWSVGQQ,1,ok first things first i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the tap was voice enabled like the echo i happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through because the echo is not meant to be a mobile device it generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have but the tap is meant to be mobile and therefore i am happy it s not a voice command device i would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it so i actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature i have the echo on my kitchen counter and the tap in my studio office and when i leave my office i just grab it and go i bought this on sale for and i went to the store and listened to many bluetooth speakers and while yes the charge sounds better all the charge can do is be a bluetooth speaker while the tap is so much more for less and the tap sounds great after looking online i was a little nervous that it would not sound that great but i was wrong about that there is no other product out there for that sounds this good and can do what the tap does i was not paid or given a tap to write this review i m just a consumer who was it the market for a bluetooth speaker and i could not be happier with my choice also if you buy this device buy the amazon sling as well trust me you will want it and honestly i am again happy i got the one that covers the bottom of the tap because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink i would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed that s it that s all buy it you won t be disappointed
"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX.

"Cons:1. Built on Android does not mean you can have Google Play Apps. This is an unfortunate inconvenience, as there are some Google Apps that are just better than their Amazon App counterparts, and a few that I can not find within the Amazon Apps. If you want a fully functional tablet, then buy a tablet and download the free kindle app. If you want to pay more for something that does less, then the kindle is for you. This was a gift, so I will keep it, and continue to use my phone for the rest of my Apps that are not available on the kindle.2. Camera is less than perfect. Limited settings available. Again, I will use my phone for pics, the same scene with my phone showed the flames, with a small amount of glare. (Husband is a firefighter, so I take a lot of pictures of their exercises for their training.) An old Casio Exilim C721 phone with 5MP camera still takes better pictures at night.3. Kindle unlimited... I can not find anything worthy of paying a subscription price every month for. The Authors I want to read are not included.4. Amazon Prime... See 3, They doubled the price, and to me I just don't see anything there worthy of the cost, including Amazon instant video, no shows that I watch are included. Another family member did the 30 day trial, and was quite disappointed when his content disappeared after the trial.5. Youtube videos work ok, sometimes choppy, could be my connection or the device (computer playback worked fine when I had the time to test simutaneously). Other online video from various sources would not play in Silk Browser, refer to 1 Chrome Browser not available to download.6. Office Suite... I can not figure out how to unlock documents.

"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel. Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device.

"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded.

"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",4.0,B01FWSVGQQ,1,i am updating my review from two months ago my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review i originally did not recommend this product but after living with it and growing to like it i am changing my recommendation the truth is the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall also it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock but it isn t as big of a problem as i thought it would be i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it leaving the top of the sling on easy off and easy back on after my only real lingering complaint would be the price for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive i am increasing my stars by one really the price is the only thing keeping this from a star for me i have come to really like the sling i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean safe while throwing it into a work bag my original is below overall i would and have recommended the sling to protect the tap received the tap and the sling cover in the last hours read more
"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it..

"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",5.0,B01FWSVGQQ,1,ok first things first i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the tap was voice enabled like the echo i happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through because the echo is not meant to be a mobile device it generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have but the tap is meant to be mobile and therefore i am happy it s not a voice command device i would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it so i actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature i have the echo on my kitchen counter and the tap in my studio office and when i leave my office i just grab it and go i bought this on sale for and i went to the store and listened to many bluetooth speakers and while yes the charge sounds better all the charge can do is be a bluetooth speaker while the tap is so much more for less and the tap sounds great after looking online i was a little nervous that it would not sound that great but i was wrong about that there is no other product out there for that sounds this good and can do what the tap does i was not paid or given a tap to write this review i m just a consumer who was it the market for a bluetooth speaker and i could not be happier with my choice also if you buy this device buy the amazon sling as well trust me you will want it and honestly i am again happy i got the one that covers the bottom of the tap because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink i would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed that s it that s all buy it you won t be disappointed

"This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more",2.0,B00NO8LX7E,0,this is a great controller for our fire tv i purchased of them with two problems but let me first talk about the good the controller works well for most of the games we play on the fire tv it has a long range compared to other controllers ive tried solid at feet and uses wifi direct instead of bluetooth the feel of it is decent not too rubbery and none of the buttons d pad or sticks have stuck or given us a problem the microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the fire tv remote now on to the problems its such an issue that im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it the worst problem is the battery life in fact its such a huge problem that im taking off stars because of it this controller eats batteries like nobodys business i have tried regular aa batteries both duracell and energizer expensive aa batteries both duracell and energizer and rechargeable aa batteries ive tried energizer apple amazonbasics the controller doesnt drain the batteries completely nope that i would understand instead the controller stops working after only a drain i kid you not every set of batteries i have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still battery life left i have tested each set before and after using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter the second problem may not be the controller itself it may be the fire tv but its affecting the controller the controller randomly disconnects not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying i have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update read more
"Without an on / off button, I have found that the controller comes on (the light comes on showing it's connected to the FireTV) even when not in use.

"Ok i've been in the technology field for close to 20 years and a gamer since the 80's so i know a little something about controllers. This really is an awesome controller with a great feel to it. It doesnt feel cheap in any way, and works perfect. It also has voice search button which works great and it has volume control via the shoulder buttons when headphones are plugged in. Ive read a few reviews about bad battery life and i havent found it an issue on mine. I bought it in late december and the batteries are due to be changed now in late april. I would like to see rechargable batteries built it instead but maybe in the future.",5.0,B00NO8LX7E,1,ok i ve been in the technology field for close to years and a gamer since the s so i know a little something about controllers this really is an awesome controller with a great feel to it it doesnt feel cheap in any way and works perfect it also has voice search button which works great and it has volume control via the shoulder buttons when headphones are plugged in ive read a few reviews about bad battery life and i havent found it an issue on mine i bought it in late december and the batteries are due to be changed now in late april i would like to see rechargable batteries built it instead but maybe in the future
"I have the original Nvidia Shield TV (not the latest 2017 version) and as such, I also have the older/bulkier controller that it came with. While it works alright, I was never that happy with it just because it's so large and clunky (I have smaller hands) and never got all that comfortable with it. So, I went searching for a replacement controller to use with it...Along came the 2017 Shield TV and a newly revamped controller. Looks nice, got good reviews, but at this time, almost impossible to find one new or used for under 50 which is a bit more than I wanted to pay for a controller.I found the Amazon Fire TV controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the Shield. Turns out that the AFT controller is NOT bluetooth, but rather, Wi-Fi direct. Did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a Shield TV.Since it's not bluetooth, trying to pair this controller with the Shield (or any other bluetooth device) is impossible. But, at the suggestion of someone on an Nvidia forum, if you go into the Shield's settings and go to the add Shield Accessory setting, while holding the home button on the AFT controller, after a few moments, indeed, it does connect and it does work. It doesn't show up as a Shield accessory (since technically, it's not) so it's kinda weird that way. Nowhere will you see in the Shield's settings or options that the controller is even connected.After connecting or pairing the AFT controller with my Shield I noticed that I lost all sound and audio. The AFT controller microphone works, but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my Shield. Needless to say that bummed me out.Read more",4.0,B00NO8LX7E,1,i have the original nvidia shield tv not the latest version and as such i also have the older bulkier controller that it came with while it works alright i was never that happy with it just because it s so large and clunky i have smaller hands and never got all that comfortable with it so i went searching for a replacement controller to use with it along came the shield tv and a newly revamped controller looks nice got good reviews but at this time almost impossible to find one new or used for under which is a bit more than i wanted to pay for a controller i found the amazon fire tv controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the shield turns out that the aft controller is not bluetooth but rather wi fi direct did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a shield tv since it s not bluetooth trying to pair this controller with the shield or any other bluetooth device is impossible but at the suggestion of someone on an nvidia forum if you go into the shield s settings and go to the add shield accessory setting while holding the home button on the aft controller after a few moments indeed it does connect and it does work it doesn t show up as a shield accessory since technically it s not so it s kinda weird that way nowhere will you see in the shield s settings or options that the controller is even connected after connecting or pairing the aft controller with my shield i noticed that i lost all sound and audio the aft controller microphone works but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my shield needless to say that bummed me out read more

"I purchased the original Kindle Fire in 2011 and the second generation Kindle Fire in 2012. I gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading. I liked both of them and I have to tell you that they have held up very well. One is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and I have not had any issues with them. Since I have not upgraded in 2 years I thought I would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster CPU and a higher resolution display. There are many improvements beyond even those features.I have to tell you that overall I am impressed with this new one. I didn't feel the need to purchase a Kindle Fire every year and when I purchased the next one I wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what I had. I stayed with the 7 inch size as I like to portability and weight for long term reading. I alternate between the Kindle Paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and I use the Kindle Fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email. This new Kindle Fire HD 2014 version is very fast and easy to use. Setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze. I like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books. The higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older Kindle Fires we own. The screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older Kindle Fires.I like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera. I use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and I own many Apple iPads, Apple iPhone and Android tablets.Read more",5.0,B00LWHUAF0,1,i purchased the original kindle fire in and the second generation kindle fire in i gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading i liked both of them and i have to tell you that they have held up very well one is over years old and the other is years old and i have not had any issues with them since i have not upgraded in years i thought i would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster cpu and a higher resolution display there are many improvements beyond even those features i have to tell you that overall i am impressed with this new one i didn t feel the need to purchase a kindle fire every year and when i purchased the next one i wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what i had i stayed with the inch size as i like to portability and weight for long term reading i alternate between the kindle paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and i use the kindle fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email this new kindle fire hd version is very fast and easy to use setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze i like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books the higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older kindle fires we own the screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older kindle fires i like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera i use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and i own many apple ipads apple iphone and android tablets read more
"The Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level Fire Tablet that includes a 7 1200x800 216 ppi pixel density display. Pixel density wise, this is the lowest off all the Fire Tablets but is still decent enough where you're going to get a nice picture on the display. It's by no means an iPad killer or Galaxy Tab killer and you really shouldn't purchase it for that purpose. This particular model is really tailored to reading Kindle books, streaming video, browsing the web, checking email, and so forth. Bottom line, It's a great deal at 139. I'm going to compare the features of the HD 7 with the features of the other Fire Tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with:*** DISPLAY ***The display is a 7 1200x800 resolution display with a 216 ppi pixel density which is not great, but not horrible either. It is the lowest pixel density of all the Fire Tablets with the Fire HD 6 coming in at 252 ppi, the Fire HDX coming in at 323 ppi, and the Fire HDX 8.9 coming in at 339 ppi. The human eye really can't distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about 300 ppi so you're not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means. All in all, this is a nice display.*** PROCESSOR, GPU, AND ON-BOARD STORAGE ***The Fire HD 7 comes with a respectable 1.5 GHz quad-core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease, including smooth video playback. It comes with a mediocre 1 GB of RAM which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is.

"I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, for 139 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year's Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend this regular Fire HD vs. a more expensive version. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire to last year's Fire HD but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has a great screen display and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model.Read more",5.0,B00LWHUAF0,1,i m writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced kindle fire user vs someone brand new to the kindle family in summary for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year s fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend this regular fire hd vs a more expensive version if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire to last year s fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire setup took a while despite being a brand new product the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs screen display video playback this version of the fire has a great screen display and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp i compared the viewing experience watching an episode of the lost ship the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year s model read more
"This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more",2.0,B00NO8LX7E,0,this is a great controller for our fire tv i purchased of them with two problems but let me first talk about the good the controller works well for most of the games we play on the fire tv it has a long range compared to other controllers ive tried solid at feet and uses wifi direct instead of bluetooth the feel of it is decent not too rubbery and none of the buttons d pad or sticks have stuck or given us a problem the microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the fire tv remote now on to the problems its such an issue that im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it the worst problem is the battery life in fact its such a huge problem that im taking off stars because of it this controller eats batteries like nobodys business i have tried regular aa batteries both duracell and energizer expensive aa batteries both duracell and energizer and rechargeable aa batteries ive tried energizer apple amazonbasics the controller doesnt drain the batteries completely nope that i would understand instead the controller stops working after only a drain i kid you not every set of batteries i have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still battery life left i have tested each set before and after using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter the second problem may not be the controller itself it may be the fire tv but its affecting the controller the controller randomly disconnects not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying i have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update read more

"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",4.0,B01FWSVGQQ,1,i am updating my review from two months ago my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review i originally did not recommend this product but after living with it and growing to like it i am changing my recommendation the truth is the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall also it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock but it isn t as big of a problem as i thought it would be i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it leaving the top of the sling on easy off and easy back on after my only real lingering complaint would be the price for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive i am increasing my stars by one really the price is the only thing keeping this from a star for me i have come to really like the sling i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean safe while throwing it into a work bag my original is below overall i would and have recommended the sling to protect the tap received the tap and the sling cover in the last hours read more
"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.)

"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",4.0,B01FWSVGQQ,1,i am updating my review from two months ago my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review i originally did not recommend this product but after living with it and growing to like it i am changing my recommendation the truth is the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall also it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock but it isn t as big of a problem as i thought it would be i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it leaving the top of the sling on easy off and easy back on after my only real lingering complaint would be the price for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive i am increasing my stars by one really the price is the only thing keeping this from a star for me i have come to really like the sling i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean safe while throwing it into a work bag my original is below overall i would and have recommended the sling to protect the tap received the tap and the sling cover in the last hours read more

"As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more",5.0,B00KDRQEYQ,1,as has been the case for years amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the kindle this one is no exception if you ve used a kindle in the past you re not going to notice much of a change with this one but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth i ll briefly go over them screen the new kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray off white paper looking background it s certainly not bright white but it s also not lcd looking dark gray it does not have buttons for page turning as the older generations do if you simply must have the page turning buttons please search for the older kindles that offer that one last thing regarding the screen this is not a kindle paperwhite or voyage where you have a back lit screen this has an unlit off white kindle screen i will say the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than i ve seen with previous generation kindles and i believe that s because amazon is using e ink s new carta displays instead of the previously used pearl displays i love that and have been waiting for years for e ink the taiwan based company that makes the kindle screens for amazon to improve them it looks like they re finally getting it the new kindle s screen resolution is ppi which is slightly lower than the kindle paperwhite which is ppi and substantially lower than the kindle voyage which boasts an impressive ppi individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye price wise though the base model paperwhite runs at the time of this review and the voyage base model runs so you can see the more you pay the better the resolution and features ppi is fine though read more
"I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more",5.0,B00KDRQEYQ,1,i ve had this kindle for a while now many of the reviews say it all so i don t think i could add much but i feel like i need to speak on behalf of this kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought if this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it so i have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us alldo you have any clue what you bought let s all say it out loud this kindle does not have a light it is an entry level model with no light amazon has always sold non lighted kindles and i still have many of them they are a cheap way to get into the e reader scene can you read a real book in the dark of course not so these non lighted kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light it is ridiculous to buy this kindle then give it a star review because it doesn t have a light read the product descriptions this kindle has no light the paperwhite and voyage do scream all to the heavens this kindle does not have page turning buttons to buy this kindle then give it a star review because your old kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane could you not see when you clicked on buy that this kindle had no page turning buttons sometimes i think there are two kinds of kindle owners those who want page turning buttons and those who don t mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page if you can tell by my sarcasm i belong to the latter bunch then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is are unable to sign on and blame it on the kindle bam another star review read more
"I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more",4.0,B00KDRQEYQ,1,i am writing this from the perspective of being a long time experienced kindle user vs someone brand new from an overall perspective considering the pricing of the kindle with special offers at vs higher amounts for the different flavors of kindle available today this one is a bargain if you have wanted to get your kids a kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because to is a lot of money to risk with a child maybe at this is your price point from a size standpoint the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e ink kindles it is slightly thicker but slightly lighter than the kindle paperwhite but to me it s not really a noticeable difference when you re holding it in a protective cover opening up the box included with the kindle is a micro usb cord but no power adapter that s really annoying interestingly and it seems rather chicken of amazon a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the kindle or if you purchase it later so if you already have a micro usb charger handy i wouldn t order one of the chargers there are no page buttons no buttons at all except for the power button and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you re reading or swiping the screen with your finger reading is easy on this one in comparison to my kindle keyboard the previous version of kindle and a kindle dx the letters on the screen are much much darker and easier to read the display is crisp and dark read more

Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!",5.0,B01FWSVGQQ,1,ok first things first i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the tap was voice enabled like the echo i happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through because the echo is not meant to be a mobile device it generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have but the tap is meant to be mobile and therefore i am happy it s not a voice command device i would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it so i actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature i have the echo on my kitchen counter and the tap in my studio office and when i leave my office i just grab it and go i bought this on sale for and i went to the store and listened to many bluetooth speakers and while yes the charge sounds better all the charge can do is be a bluetooth speaker while the tap is so much more for less and the tap sounds great after looking online i was a little nervous that it would not sound that great but i was wrong about that there is no other product out there for that sounds this good and can do what the tap does i was not paid or given a tap to write this review i m just a consumer who was it the market for a bluetooth speaker and i could not be happier with my choice also if you buy this device buy the amazon sling as well trust me you will want it and honestly i am again happy i got the one that covers the bottom of the tap because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink i would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed that s it that s all buy it you won t be disappointed

"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more",5.0,B00OQVZDJM,1,review updated september as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing this review from the perspective of being a long time kindle user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindle the and new paperwhite the fire hd fire hd fire hdx and fire hdx this review is for the all new kindle paperwhite the attached picture shows the kindle on the left and the new kindle on the right here is the summary of my initial impressions of the model versus the model i am somewhat disappointed in the version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model the paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation model to its second generation model especially in the display and processor area the model came with gb storage a wonderful display a great battery and was the e book workhorse the second generation model changed by only increasing storage to gb the third generation model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly what comes in the box a paperwhite device a quick start guide and a short usb cord amazon still does not supply a power adapter size its the same identical size as the older paperwhites the weight has been reduced slightly from to ounces a fraction of an ounce most likely because of a smaller battery the good news is that all cases that fit the other paperwhites will fit the version display the resolution has been bumped up to ppi equivalent to the voyage read more

"I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie.",5.0,B00VKLBU3Y,1,i previously owned an asus infinity with inch screen until it died on vacation and i grabbed the smaller gb fire during the one day sale i could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here i am with the new inch fire if you liked your fire you will love this the gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books music and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card and it s about time amazon makes a version that can do this the storage is enough for even most power users set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions within minutes out of the box i was surfing the web checking my email and posting on facebook after charging the battery to full i streamed a one hour tv show from netflix and when i checked afterwards the battery was still at percent i am writing this review on it right now if you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out i can at least watch a movie
"I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more",3.0,B00VKLBU3Y,0,i bought this tablet for its size economical price point and the ability to watch content offline and it offers exactly that but falls short on performance parameters if you re price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet large screen and the ability to watch content offline this is a great device to get however if you already have an earlier kindle like the hdx or even an earlier version of the fire i recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn t really be a worthwhile upgrade i have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device the constant freezing of the device slow speed to load apps significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network and the frequent need to reboot the device all factors made this a frustrating device to own the hdx is far better in every aspect heck even the original fire runs better than this device the only good things about this device are the screen size and the microsd slot so if you re only watching videos on this and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you re traveling this tablet would be just fine otherwise the hdx is still a better option or you could get the or fire models those are priced cheaper and work better original review is below for the price point and size alone the fire hd would seem like a good deal for its performance however it falls short of expectations i would probably rate it a overall if it wasn t for the price the rating would have been even lower read more
"What a DEAL............ I got this great tablet for a great price on Prime Day..... but was a little concerned it would be too big..to handle. but I was wrong.First I I was very surprised.. by several things about the Fire 10 that made me SMILE:......1) even though it is large in size the weight is LIGHT so it is much easier to handle than expected ( esp since my fire HD 8.9 HEAVY unit )).......2.) it does several things I wasn't expecting.. One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO.. Google Play store can be easily added without disrupting you Amazon experience ( look it up on youtube))( it took less than 4 minutes and it was Up and RUNNING ))....... 5.) I think the Screen is Beautiful............ ( cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks Great to me) 6.) FINALLY they put the speakers in the FRONT so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc 7.) I think this is My FAV............I put in a great big 125g sd card and I am loaded to download anything I choose... loads of Movie from the A Amazon Prime Movies,..................ALL of my audio books from Audible.................and a huge amt of my Kindle Books...........I am delighted....... and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format..........ESP. now that google PLAY STORE is on it .Happy Happy Happy......",5.0,B00VKLBU3Y,1,what a deal i got this great tablet for a great price on prime day but was a little concerned it would be too big to handle but i was wrong first i i was very surprised by several things about the fire that made me smile even though it is large in size the weight is light so it is much easier to handle than expected esp since my fire hd heavy unit it does several things i wasn t expecting one is it has screen mirroring that means you can see your tablets screen on you great big tv screen if you choose for games or what ever smooth and fast due to the nice processor whoo hoo google play store can be easily added without disrupting you amazon experience look it up on youtube it took less than minutes and it was up and running i think the screen is beautiful cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks great to me finally they put the speakers in the front so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc i think this is my fav i put in a great big g sd card and i am loaded to download anything i choose loads of movie from the a amazon prime movies all of my audio books from audible and a huge amt of my kindle books i am delighted and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format esp now that google play store is on it happy happy happy
"This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9 HDX and the new 6. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far.",5.0,B00VKLBU3Y,1,this is my th kindle fire i also have the first generation an hdx and the new the first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is despite being the largest fire to date i love the more narrow widescreen design of the screen perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode anyway before i get carried away gushing ill just list my pros and one or two cons to make this easier to read and save time pros wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books the stereo speakers sound incredible even better than the previous hdx modelfor comic book readers comics purchased from amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from comixology i was wondering when amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics finally battery life seems to be similar to my hdx but im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device considerably faster response time across the board finally we can add a micro sd card to expand storage capacity yay the camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous firecons would have preferred a rubberized back and case the glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also still deciding on the new software layout maybe its because im so familiar with the old fire os but lets just say im not blown away be the design so far
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading).",5.0,B01LW1MS9C,1,i m a huge fan of the echo family i have two echo s three dots and one tap no they aren t essential to my life but i love playing music listening to the news and controlling the philips hue smart lights throughout my home it was a large investment that most of the population won t make with that being said i am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck dots look like glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them having the dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose i m not sure why people are moving their dots since dots are made to be stationary have a loose fitting cover isn t an issue to me it fits perfectly they also aren t made of real fabric but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your dot happens to get sunlight i bought three covers blue grey and white they all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn t attract more attention than it needs to with that being said i like all three colors edit these covers hold up well over time mine haven t collected dust or faded i ve kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue not that i d expect any besides possible fading
"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop.

"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen.

"I purchased 3 of these Kindle kids edition tablets for my toddlers (ages 4,3,2 years old) And 1 non kids edition one for our older child for Easter. I was quite nervous that they'd break or the cases wouldn't be durable or that they wouldn't be able to use the apps they'd been using on my Samsung Tab S.After considering the price to purchase 3 of them and checking out the apps my husband and I were pretty sure we would purchase them. Then I came across the warranty. 2 year worry free guarantee! Are you kidding me I knew there had to be a catch, I couldn't find one and at that point we were convinced it would be a good investment.I ordered 3 (at the time pink and blue were our only color choices) So we have 1 pink and 2 blue. Which has caused a host of issues on the toddler level (identifying who's tablet is who's as you can imagine)They were easy to set up and create their own profiles and add apps to each of their tables . I love the unlimited freetime, they've had their tables for a few months now and can completely work them themselves and download the apps/movies/books that they want. I don't have to do it for them (with the exception of my 2 year old of course). I was able to link our Disney movies anywhere account with our Amazon account and now they can access all of our Disney digital movies on their tables! Which was a huge win for us! I do wish that Amazon could figure out a way for us to be able to link our Ultraviolet movies, it's a huge bummer that Amazon doesn't offer any app to make that possible. I also love that I can login to my Amazon account and send apps/movies etc to their tablets as I see fit, I can locate and page their tables when they are misplaced and remote lock them if I need to .Read more",4.0,B010BWYP20,1,i purchased of these kindle kids edition tablets for my toddlers ages years old and non kids edition one for our older child for easter i was quite nervous that they d break or the cases wouldn t be durable or that they wouldn t be able to use the apps they d been using on my samsung tab s after considering the price to purchase of them and checking out the apps my husband and i were pretty sure we would purchase them then i came across the warranty year worry free guarantee are you kidding me i knew there had to be a catch i couldn t find one and at that point we were convinced it would be a good investment i ordered at the time pink and blue were our only color choices so we have pink and blue which has caused a host of issues on the toddler level identifying who s tablet is who s as you can imagine they were easy to set up and create their own profiles and add apps to each of their tables i love the unlimited freetime they ve had their tables for a few months now and can completely work them themselves and download the apps movies books that they want i don t have to do it for them with the exception of my year old of course i was able to link our disney movies anywhere account with our amazon account and now they can access all of our disney digital movies on their tables which was a huge win for us i do wish that amazon could figure out a way for us to be able to link our ultraviolet movies it s a huge bummer that amazon doesn t offer any app to make that possible i also love that i can login to my amazon account and send apps movies etc to their tablets as i see fit i can locate and page their tables when they are misplaced and remote lock them if i need to read more
"As the Kids Edition is nothing more than a basic 50 7 Kindle Fire with some extras, this review is primarily concerned with the 50-worth of extras bundled with the Kids Edition. Primarily, the year of included Freetime.As for the guts of the tablet itself, it's fine. Not great, but certainly fine. It's not the fastest tablet. It isn't the most feature-rich tablet. It doesn't have the sharpest display. But it's only 50, so it deserves to be graded on a curve. For a 50 tablet, it's great.Now, grab a coffee, get comfortable, because I have some thoughts on Amazon's Freetime service for kids/parents:Price plus the year of Freetime were the selling points for me (the case and added warranty were nice bonuses). The problem is, Freetime, though fantastic in theory, isn't even half-baked. It's a lump of dough left on the counter to rise. And then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it. It's getting moldy, and it smells kind of funny.Freetime: great in theory, terrible in practice.Normally, when you buy a new tablet, it might have a little bloatware pre-installed, but you generally don't start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen. You find and add the apps you want.The way you install/remove apps in Freetime is sort of backwards. It's subtractive. Every single title is served up on the home screen (and in the apps, books, videos screens). These aren't technically pre-installed, but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons, it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal. Well, he does. But only sort of. He clicks Elmo's face, and the wheel starts spinning over the icon while it downloads.Read more",1.0,B010BWYP20,0,as the kids edition is nothing more than a basic kindle fire with some extras this review is primarily concerned with the worth of extras bundled with the kids edition primarily the year of included freetime as for the guts of the tablet itself it s fine not great but certainly fine it s not the fastest tablet it isn t the most feature rich tablet it doesn t have the sharpest display but it s only so it deserves to be graded on a curve for a tablet it s great now grab a coffee get comfortable because i have some thoughts on amazon s freetime service for kids parents price plus the year of freetime were the selling points for me the case and added warranty were nice bonuses the problem is freetime though fantastic in theory isn t even half baked it s a lump of dough left on the counter to rise and then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it it s getting moldy and it smells kind of funny freetime great in theory terrible in practice normally when you buy a new tablet it might have a little bloatware pre installed but you generally don t start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen you find and add the apps you want the way you install remove apps in freetime is sort of backwards it s subtractive every single title is served up on the home screen and in the apps books videos screens these aren t technically pre installed but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal well he does but only sort of he clicks elmo s face and the wheel starts spinning over the icon while it downloads read more
"*Edit 12/23/15*It appears that the linked SD card below and the one made for Fire tablets are the same price now, although the Fire one still does not come with an adapter.

For 100, you get:7 Kindle Fire without sponsored lockscreens 65Kid-proof case 202-year accident protection 161-year of Free Time Unlimited 36 minimumThat's a nice value! I've seen a few reviews where people are upset that it doesn't work without Wi-Fi, but I'm not sure what their expectations are. If you have previously download an app/game/video and it doesn't require internet access (some do, some don't), it works fine. As for performance, it's OK. Not great. It freezes every now and then and needs to be rebooted more often than I'd like to get it working again. This is frustrating to a 3-year-old, as you can imagine. Hard to complain too much given the price, but I was expecting it to be more stable.You will want to buy a micro SD card because the Fire OS takes up 5 of the 8 GB of on-board storage. This is where Amazon is doing something that is, shall we say, a little sketchy.

"I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie.",5.0,B00VKM5NFY,1,i previously owned an asus infinity with inch screen until it died on vacation and i grabbed the smaller gb fire during the one day sale i could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here i am with the new inch fire if you liked your fire you will love this the gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books music and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card and it s about time amazon makes a version that can do this the storage is enough for even most power users set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions within minutes out of the box i was surfing the web checking my email and posting on facebook after charging the battery to full i streamed a one hour tv show from netflix and when i checked afterwards the battery was still at percent i am writing this review on it right now if you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out i can at least watch a movie
"I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more",3.0,B00VKM5NFY,0,i bought this tablet for its size economical price point and the ability to watch content offline and it offers exactly that but falls short on performance parameters if you re price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet large screen and the ability to watch content offline this is a great device to get however if you already have an earlier kindle like the hdx or even an earlier version of the fire i recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn t really be a worthwhile upgrade i have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device the constant freezing of the device slow speed to load apps significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network and the frequent need to reboot the device all factors made this a frustrating device to own the hdx is far better in every aspect heck even the original fire runs better than this device the only good things about this device are the screen size and the microsd slot so if you re only watching videos on this and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you re traveling this tablet would be just fine otherwise the hdx is still a better option or you could get the or fire models those are priced cheaper and work better original review is below for the price point and size alone the fire hd would seem like a good deal for its performance however it falls short of expectations i would probably rate it a overall if it wasn t for the price the rating would have been even lower read more

One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO.. Google Play store can be easily added without disrupting you Amazon experience ( look it up on youtube))( it took less than 4 minutes and it was Up and RUNNING ))....... 5.) I think the Screen is Beautiful............ ( cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks Great to me) 6.) FINALLY they put the speakers in the FRONT so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc 7.) I think this is My FAV............I put in a great big 125g sd card and I am loaded to download anything I choose... loads of Movie from the A Amazon Prime Movies,..................ALL of my audio books from Audible.................and a huge amt of my Kindle Books...........I am delighted....... and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format..........ESP. now that google PLAY STORE is on it .Happy Happy Happy......",5.0,B00VKM5NFY,1,what a deal i got this great tablet for a great price on prime day but was a little concerned it would be too big to handle but i was wrong first i i was very surprised by several things about the fire that made me smile even though it is large in size the weight is light so it is much easier to handle than expected esp since my fire hd heavy unit it does several things i wasn t expecting one is it has screen mirroring that means you can see your tablets screen on you great big tv screen if you choose for games or what ever smooth and fast due to the nice processor whoo hoo google play store can be easily added without disrupting you amazon experience look it up on youtube it took less than minutes and it was up and running i think the screen is beautiful cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks great to me finally they put the speakers in the front so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc i think this is my fav i put in a great big g sd card and i am loaded to download anything i choose loads of movie from the a amazon prime movies all of my audio books from audible and a huge amt of my kindle books i am delighted and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format esp now that google play store is on it happy happy happy
"This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9 HDX and the new 6. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far.",5.0,B00VKM5NFY,1,this is my th kindle fire i also have the first generation an hdx and the new the first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is despite being the largest fire to date i love the more narrow widescreen design of the screen perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode anyway before i get carried away gushing ill just list my pros and one or two cons to make this easier to read and save time pros wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books the stereo speakers sound incredible even better than the previous hdx modelfor comic book readers comics purchased from amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from comixology i was wondering when amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics finally battery life seems to be similar to my hdx but im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device considerably faster response time across the board finally we can add a micro sd card to expand storage capacity yay the camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous firecons would have preferred a rubberized back and case the glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also still deciding on the new software layout maybe its because im so familiar with the old fire os but lets just say im not blown away be the design so far
"This was really worth the wait. I bought the Echo Show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments. Since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, I didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. So, last year, I bought and installed the Ring Doorbell Pro in their house, which works very well. The Ring Doorbell Pro is hardwired and not battery operated. After the skill was enabled, I could tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. You really need a good Wi-Fi router with the Echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. If you have a good Wi-Fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. I thought the doorbell would launch the app on the Echo Show automatically, but it does not. You have to initiate the connection yourself. Hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. I can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the Ring Doorbell Pro.The battery powered Ring products do not work as great though. When trying to connect the Echo Show to a battery powered Ring device, I get a message saying something like, The camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec. This happens with my Ring Stickup Camera. So, if you want the best experience, you should buy the Ring Doorbell Pro instead of the battery powered versions.One of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call. So, we have another Echo Show, just for her, in drop in mode.Read more",4.0,B01KIOU4EO,1,this was really worth the wait i bought the echo show for my parents who are elderly and have a variety of ailments since they have arthritis and a few other issues i didn t want them to go and answer the doorbell just to find it s someone soliciting them to buy random junk so last year i bought and installed the ring doorbell pro in their house which works very well the ring doorbell pro is hardwired and not battery operated after the skill was enabled i could tell alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up you really need a good wi fi router with the echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality if you have a good wi fi router the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth i thought the doorbell would launch the app on the echo show automatically but it does not you have to initiate the connection yourself hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill i can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do but for a very first implementation it works great with the hardwired version of the ring doorbell pro the battery powered ring products do not work as great though when trying to connect the echo show to a battery powered ring device i get a message saying something like the camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take sec this happens with my ring stickup camera so if you want the best experience you should buy the ring doorbell pro instead of the battery powered versions one of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn t have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call so we have another echo show just for her in drop in mode read more
"Initially I gave the Echo Show a 3 star rating. In all fairness after about 20 days of use I've decided to change my score and here's why. First off Amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice. I appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device. I've also noticed quite a few updates in the short time I've had my Show and honestly things are changing for the better. I've been updating my review and will continue to do so as I've noticed updates and get more hands on experience. After separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device I've come to the conclusion that the Show still had me wanting more despite it's capabilities. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen. A few people mentioned why don't you put it on your desk.Read more",4.0,B01KIOU4EO,1,initially i gave the echo show a star rating in all fairness after about days of use i ve decided to change my score and here s why first off amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice i appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device i ve also noticed quite a few updates in the short time i ve had my show and honestly things are changing for the better i ve been updating my review and will continue to do so as i ve noticed updates and get more hands on experience after separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device i ve come to the conclusion that the show still had me wanting more despite it s capabilities i currently own the original echo which is in my living room a dot in my bedroom and one at work i have lights fans a thermostat surround sound and tv all connected to my alexa devices of course i had to buy one with a screen i m a big fan of alexa the products have become a routine part of my day as soon as the show was available to preorder i ordered one without any hesitation initially i wanted to put my show on a inch tv stand by my inch tv where my original echo was i figured it wouldn t look bad because i could use it as a digital picture frame also i don t have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a inch screen from feet away wasn t going to work for me my show now sits on my kitchen counter i figured i d get more use out of it in my living room because most of my alexa enabled devices are in there and generally i spend more time in my living room than the kitchen a few people mentioned why don t you put it on your desk read more
"The Amazon Echo Show is a voice-activated device. You can instruct it to play video content, play music, stream online audio, order products and services, and control home automation products. The Echo Show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen, which in my opinion, greatly enhances the use and potential of this device.Ive been using this device for a few days so far. Below you will find some of my initial impressions: What I Like Good build quality: The Show has a nice, bright screen that has good viewing angles.Good sound: The speakers on the Show sound much better than the original echo.Easy setup: Setup was extremely easy, mostly due to the Shows touch screen. After making a few selections, the Show was up and running in no time.Content suggestions: When you aren't interacting with the Show, it continuously displays content suggestions. I like that it will suggest videos to watch.Video content: I like being able to view Amazon Video, video news briefings, movie trailers, and YouTube videos on the Show.Video calling: Video calling works as advertised. I like being able to initiate a call with my voice.Music with lyrics: When playing songs from Amazon Music, you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen.Home automation: Like other Echos, the Show can control your smart home products. The show has the extra ability to display camera feeds.On-screen apps: The echo can display my calendar, reminders, lists, timers, local weather, and more. Because of this, I find the Show infinitely more useful than the original Echo. What I Don't Like The Show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen.Read more",5.0,B01KIOU4EO,1,the amazon echo show is a voice activated device you can instruct it to play video content play music stream online audio order products and services and control home automation products the echo show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen which in my opinion greatly enhances the use and potential of this device ive been using this device for a few days so far below you will find some of my initial impressions what i like good build quality the show has a nice bright screen that has good viewing angles good sound the speakers on the show sound much better than the original echo easy setup setup was extremely easy mostly due to the shows touch screen after making a few selections the show was up and running in no time content suggestions when you aren t interacting with the show it continuously displays content suggestions i like that it will suggest videos to watch video content i like being able to view amazon video video news briefings movie trailers and youtube videos on the show video calling video calling works as advertised i like being able to initiate a call with my voice music with lyrics when playing songs from amazon music you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen home automation like other echos the show can control your smart home products the show has the extra ability to display camera feeds on screen apps the echo can display my calendar reminders lists timers local weather and more because of this i find the show infinitely more useful than the original echo what i don t like the show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen read more

You will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom.

"I've only had my Echo Show just a little over 24 hours now, so please take that into consideration. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and tv all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that a viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because I generally spend more time in their than the kitchen.The problem with displaying the show on a kichen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on, so if you aren't standing directly in front of it, it's hard to view the screen. You will have to turn it in a dirction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom.

"First day with the echo show. I'm pretty pleased with it. Some observations that I think have not been hit in most reviews:* Sound quality seems similar to that of the Echo cylinder. Good for a desktop listening experience, not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound.* The Show does have an ambient light sensor (using the camera) so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down. When I darkened the room at night to work at my PC, the Show display dimmed to the point where I could just make out the time, and not the background photo at all.* Much has been made of the Show displaying lyrics when playing Prime music. That doesn't appeal to me, but when playing music from Spotify, Pandora, and My Music on Amazon, the Show displays the song title, artist name, album art, and a progress indicator. That's really nice when listening to playlists - I was always asking my Echo cylinder Alexa, what's that song* Alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my Pandora channels. With the show, if Alexa doesn't recognize the name, I can ask it to display my Pandora channels and select them fro mthe Show touch screen, It's good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the Alexa app, then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection.* Some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs.* You can set the Show to use an album from Amazon Prime Photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive. AFAIK, other photo servers cannot be used.",5.0,B01KIOU4EO,1,first day with the echo show i m pretty pleased with it some observations that i think have not been hit in most reviews sound quality seems similar to that of the echo cylinder good for a desktop listening experience not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound the show does have an ambient light sensor using the camera so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down when i darkened the room at night to work at my pc the show display dimmed to the point where i could just make out the time and not the background photo at all much has been made of the show displaying lyrics when playing prime music that doesn t appeal to me but when playing music from spotify pandora and my music on amazon the show displays the song title artist name album art and a progress indicator that s really nice when listening to playlists i was always asking my echo cylinder alexa what s that song alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my pandora channels with the show if alexa doesn t recognize the name i can ask it to display my pandora channels and select them fro mthe show touch screen it s good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the alexa app then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs you can set the show to use an album from amazon prime photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive afaik other photo servers cannot be used

I've owned several different tablets. This one is by far the slowest. And I don't mean it's a little slower. I mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. Opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. I've had far more issues with this Fire than any of the others we've owned. If I had realized the difference in speed I would have kept my old one. It's definitely not work the larger screen. It's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be.

Have had this probably 3 weeks. Wanted to be fair with my review. The battery in my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. Why Amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but I'm doing ok now with the 10.

"I have now owned 4 Kindles and just love them! My first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse. I had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank. I then got 2 Kindle Fires. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other. I have had no problem with the Fire once I broke down and read some of the direction, if all else fails. Other than operator error I have used it for over a year but it's too heavy for my old overused hands. Not heavy though. Books now give me problems. Even paperbacks. But I then bought the smaller, lighter new Kindle and loved it from the first. I carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months. I called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one. This time I bought a light weight cover for it. I don't like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it I have to protect it. I have had this one for months and have had no problems. I now have about 600 books awaiting my pleasure! I just looked the Kindles over again.

"DON'T BUY a reburbished Kindle. I've had to return them, twice.

"Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go.

"Since other people have gone into detail on the device, I will answer only the burning questions I had before I received mine. I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust. Settings/Device Options/Screen Light. I'm not actually sure that the night light is working. It was at 18 when I turned off the light (this is quite bright), and I checked it about 10 minutes later, and it was at 17.Read more",5.0,B01J2G4VBG,1,since other people have gone into detail on the device i will answer only the burning questions i had before i received mine i was very happy with my paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen lost not sure which my husband still has his paperwhite so i was able to compare them side by side can i use the wall charger from my paperwhite to charge the voyageyes can pressing the page turners cause repetitive use issuesi don t think so you can turn down the pressure it needs which is very slight or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap it s actually nice to have both options can you see where to turn the pages in the darkno you can guess where the page forward area is but the page back is a dot so guessing would be difficult but you can still tap to turn pages using a cover helps as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot does the feedback buzz annoy you when you turn pagesi think it does take a little getting used to but you can turn it down and i think i will not notice it after a while there s no sound it s purely tactile months later it s not distracting you forget about it is the adjustable light nicei still do it manually it doesn t adjust the way i d like it to not as bright in good light as i d like and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me note that if you want to use the night light you have to set that separately from auto adjust settings device options screen light i m not actually sure that the night light is working it was at when i turned off the light this is quite bright and i checked it about minutes later and it was at read more
"I've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more",3.0,B01J2G4VBG,0,i ve got mixed feelings on this one unfortunately this review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the st generation size weight it s noticeably smaller and lighter than the paperwhite when i saw the specs it didn t really strike me as something that would make much difference to me but in real life it s actually great the voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into origami cover i know there s a separate product page for the origami cover but it s worth mentioning here as it is the official cover the origami cover is ugly and i was skeptical but i actually love it it s weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad this actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open in my opinion it s hard to describe but there are a lot more ways to hold the voyage when it s attached to this cover and just generally is more comfortable to use the origami part of the case works great as well it stands vertically or horizontally if you re laying down and reading this is amazing the other great new thing about this case is that the voyage attaches to it magnetically it attaches and detaches very easily unlike the paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case this is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light thin it is without a case attached it s super easy to take it out it s pricey but worth it pagepress one of the new features is pagepress which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages read more

"Review updated September 17, 2015As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the 2013, 2014 and new 2015 Paperwhite, the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9. This review is for the 2015 All-New Kindle Paperwhite. The attached picture shows the 2014 Kindle on the left and the new 2015 Kindle on the right. Here is the summary of my initial impressions of the 2015 model versus the 2014 model.I am somewhat disappointed in the 2015 version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model. The Paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation 2012 model to its second generation 2013 model, especially in the display and processor area. The 2013 model came with 2 GB storage, a wonderful display, a great battery and was the e-book workhorse. The second generation 2014 model changed by only increasing storage to 4 GB. The third generation 2015 model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: A Paperwhite device, a quick-start guide and a short USB cord. Amazon still does not supply a power adapter.SIZE: Its the same identical size as the older Paperwhites. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.3 to 7.2 ounces, a fraction of an ounce, most likely because of a smaller battery.The good news is that all cases that fit the other Paperwhites will fit the 2015 version!!DISPLAY: The resolution has been bumped up to 300 ppi, equivalent to the Voyage.Read more",5.0,B00QJDS7I4,1,review updated september as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing this review from the perspective of being a long time kindle user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindle the and new paperwhite the fire hd fire hd fire hdx and fire hdx this review is for the all new kindle paperwhite the attached picture shows the kindle on the left and the new kindle on the right here is the summary of my initial impressions of the model versus the model i am somewhat disappointed in the version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model the paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation model to its second generation model especially in the display and processor area the model came with gb storage a wonderful display a great battery and was the e book workhorse the second generation model changed by only increasing storage to gb the third generation model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly what comes in the box a paperwhite device a quick start guide and a short usb cord amazon still does not supply a power adapter size its the same identical size as the older paperwhites the weight has been reduced slightly from to ounces a fraction of an ounce most likely because of a smaller battery the good news is that all cases that fit the other paperwhites will fit the version display the resolution has been bumped up to ppi equivalent to the voyage read more

"I'm a long time Kindle user, and have upgraded a number of times. Every upgrade was a significant improvement, and the Oasis continues that trend. I love my Voyage, but the Oasis makes it feel like a hardback book. The pictures and descriptions don't do the size and weight justice. Shockingly light, and small even with the case. Used without the case, it's like holding a few sheets of paper. Amazing. Haven't had it long enough to evaluate the battery life, but never had a problem with the previous models, so I assume the promise of much longer battery life (with the secondary battery in the case) is accurate.The balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good. With the case feels a bit like the Voyage (although quite a bit lighter than my Voyage in its case). Case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed. Screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my Voyage (maybe due to the updated lighting system).I had the 'pressure sensitive' page turner option on my Voyage turned off. Much too jumpy and sensitive, even at its 'hard' setting. I won't miss that. The new mechanical buttons on the Oasis are AWESOME. Nice upgrade there, and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part.Yes, it is pricey. I would say if you are a 'few hour a week' reader, the Paperwhite is your best bet (solid performance and very good price/value). But if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day (like me!), the extra battery life and the balance/size/weight, along with the slightly improved screen is WELL worth the money, especially when spread over the life of the unit.Edit: A few more comments now that I've been using the Oasis for a number of months.Read more",5.0,B010EK1GOE,1,i m a long time kindle user and have upgraded a number of times every upgrade was a significant improvement and the oasis continues that trend i love my voyage but the oasis makes it feel like a hardback book the pictures and descriptions don t do the size and weight justice shockingly light and small even with the case used without the case it s like holding a few sheets of paper amazing haven t had it long enough to evaluate the battery life but never had a problem with the previous models so i assume the promise of much longer battery life with the secondary battery in the case is accurate the balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good with the case feels a bit like the voyage although quite a bit lighter than my voyage in its case case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my voyage maybe due to the updated lighting system i had the pressure sensitive page turner option on my voyage turned off much too jumpy and sensitive even at its hard setting i won t miss that the new mechanical buttons on the oasis are awesome nice upgrade there and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part yes it is pricey i would say if you are a few hour a week reader the paperwhite is your best bet solid performance and very good price value but if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day like me the extra battery life and the balance size weight along with the slightly improved screen is well worth the money especially when spread over the life of the unit edit a few more comments now that i ve been using the oasis for a number of months read more
"Note: My original Kindle Oasis review was posted on 4/29/16 on this product page on Amazon: New - Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover. This page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the U.S. My original review follows.UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th.Read more",5.0,B010EK1GOE,1,note my original kindle oasis review was posted on on this product page on amazon new kindle oasis e reader with leather charging cover this page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the u s my original review follows update after using my oasis for almost months i thought i would add a brief comment to my original review i have settled on using the oasis for reading in bed where it s lighter and easier to hold and i prefer the page turn button style for my reading elsewhere for example if i want to read while eating i use my voyage w origami case to hold it upright i can read the same book using both kindles since they stay synch d to one another and it s given me basically the best of both worlds at least for my style of reading the voyage with cover almost seems clunky bulkier and heavier compared to the oasis but when it s sitting on a table it hardly matters i have to say that i m fortunate in being able to afford both and the new base model kindle that i recently picked up is not yet getting much use even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non illuminated display works just fine my original review follows amazon released the first kindle in november of eight and a half years later the oasis model is the th generation kindle and the third evolution of kindle with built in illumination the price of was a bit of a shock but i ordered mine as soon as it was announced on april th read more
"This is my 4th Kindle since I bought my first one as soon as Kindle was launched. With every new model, I was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends. The Voyager was the first time I felt somewhat frustrated with an Amazon product.Yes, it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models - if you are buying your first one, don't hesitate - it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an iPad - even if it is an iPad Mini.But... There are a few things that I thing Amazon should fix on this one, specially because it is the top of the line Kindle:1. The battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself. The magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader. Previous covers just stayed in place and even the Apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one.2. As you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side, you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen. The way I got used to handle the kindle and as I constantly change hands when I am reading, I get a lot of undesired page turns because I touched the screen somewhere. A very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device.3. Battery life (even with the cover) is far from what I expected. My old Kindle had a battery that lasted for more than a month, the new one needs recharging every 15 days.4. The device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple,e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag.5.Read more",2.0,B010EK1GOE,0,this is my th kindle since i bought my first one as soon as kindle was launched with every new model i was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends the voyager was the first time i felt somewhat frustrated with an amazon product yes it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models if you are buying your first one don t hesitate it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an ipad even if it is an ipad mini but there are a few things that i thing amazon should fix on this one specially because it is the top of the line kindle the battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself the magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader previous covers just stayed in place and even the apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one as you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen the way i got used to handle the kindle and as i constantly change hands when i am reading i get a lot of undesired page turns because i touched the screen somewhere a very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device battery life even with the cover is far from what i expected my old kindle had a battery that lasted for more than a month the new one needs recharging every days the device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag read more
"The new Fire HDX 8.9 is definitely one powerful tablet, packed with some pretty nice features. While it does have some small flaws here and there, it generally is an all around great buy. I'll go over some of what I've noticed using the tablet, what I've learned from others who are using it, as well as the specs and how I feel about them. Hopefully it'll give you more insight into the product and help you make an easier decision whether or not to buy it.*** BUILD QUALITY ***One of the first things I noticed was the outstanding build quality. The tablet weighs less than much of its competition, and provides a nice feel due to the materials used in making the case which gives you a nice grip so you don't drop the tablet as easily. Everything feels solid... it doesn't have that cheap feel that some of the Android based tablets have. Apple still holds the title for most durable case as it's aluminum but unless you plan on throwing this thing around, you don't need the aluminum... it weighs more and it's cold!*** SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR AND GPU ***This new HDX 8.9 comes with the 2.5Ghz Snapdragon processor and a nice GPU so this is going to be one of your fastest tablets on the market at the moment, if not the fastest. Intel and NVIDIA are continuously working on CPU's for the tablet and Chromebook markets, bragging about their performance and how they blow away the competition. Acer, for example, is utilizing an NVIDIA Tegra K1 ARM based CPU running at 2.1GHz quad-core. That is insanely fast for something like a Chromebook which functionality wise, is pretty much the same thing as a tablet. Unfortunately for Acer, the Snapdragon CPU on the Fire HDX is more powerful (2.5 GHz vs. 2.1 GHz) and appears to be using less power.Read more",5.0,B00LWHUB9A,1,the new fire hdx is definitely one powerful tablet packed with some pretty nice features while it does have some small flaws here and there it generally is an all around great buy i ll go over some of what i ve noticed using the tablet what i ve learned from others who are using it as well as the specs and how i feel about them hopefully it ll give you more insight into the product and help you make an easier decision whether or not to buy it build quality one of the first things i noticed was the outstanding build quality the tablet weighs less than much of its competition and provides a nice feel due to the materials used in making the case which gives you a nice grip so you don t drop the tablet as easily everything feels solid it doesn t have that cheap feel that some of the android based tablets have apple still holds the title for most durable case as it s aluminum but unless you plan on throwing this thing around you don t need the aluminum it weighs more and it s cold snapdragon processor and gpu this new hdx comes with the ghz snapdragon processor and a nice gpu so this is going to be one of your fastest tablets on the market at the moment if not the fastest intel and nvidia are continuously working on cpu s for the tablet and chromebook markets bragging about their performance and how they blow away the competition acer for example is utilizing an nvidia tegra k arm based cpu running at ghz quad core that is insanely fast for something like a chromebook which functionality wise is pretty much the same thing as a tablet unfortunately for acer the snapdragon cpu on the fire hdx is more powerful ghz vs ghz and appears to be using less power read more
"Great device it's zippy, has an AWESOME display, great sound for a tablet (rivals/bests any portable device I currently own, including laptops) has incredible ease of use and I'm basically all-in on the Amazon ecosystem. I know people lament the loss of Google Play, but I'm a simple guy who doesn't actually need absolutely everything. I can watch movies/videos from the major streaming services I use (Netflix/Prime), music (Pandora, Spotify, Prime), the various apps I use for fantasy sports, reading emails, ebooks (honestly the main reason I bought this thing), and reddit. That's more or less all I need it to do, and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly.The reason for the 3 star is because, as of this review, the device has the SUPREMELY ANNOYING HABIT OF LOCKING UP. It seems to happen most often when I'm running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off. It occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day, but this is a device that I only use when I'm traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer, so those 1-3 times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities.Example of a recent situation: I'm waiting for my class to start so I'm hanging out at the college library, listening to some stuff on Prime while flipping through reddit, with headphones on. It's time to go in, so I switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag. Except it locks up the screen stops moving, I lose any and all functions to use it, and the music just KEEPS ON PLAYING. I can't shut it off.Read more",3.0,B00LWHUB9A,0,great device it s zippy has an awesome display great sound for a tablet rivals bests any portable device i currently own including laptops has incredible ease of use and i m basically all in on the amazon ecosystem i know people lament the loss of google play but i m a simple guy who doesn t actually need absolutely everything i can watch movies videos from the major streaming services i use netflix prime music pandora spotify prime the various apps i use for fantasy sports reading emails ebooks honestly the main reason i bought this thing and reddit that s more or less all i need it to do and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly the reason for the star is because as of this review the device has the supremely annoying habit of locking up it seems to happen most often when i m running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off it occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day but this is a device that i only use when i m traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer so those times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities example of a recent situation i m waiting for my class to start so i m hanging out at the college library listening to some stuff on prime while flipping through reddit with headphones on it s time to go in so i switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag except it locks up the screen stops moving i lose any and all functions to use it and the music just keeps on playing i can t shut it off read more
"I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding. If you are a first-time large-screen tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions, I'd recommend it. If you're comparing last year's HDX model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to last year's Fire HDX but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the best screen display of any previous model of Fire and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp in a side-by-side comparison to last years HDX version and my iPad Air (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work): I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship.Read more",5.0,B00LWHUB9A,1,i m writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced kindle fire user vs someone brand new to the kindle family in summary you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding if you are a first time large screen tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions i d recommend it if you re comparing last year s hdx model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire hdx to last year s fire hdx but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire setup took a while despite being a brand new product the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs screen display video playback this version of the fire has the best screen display of any previous model of fire and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp in a side by side comparison to last years hdx version and my ipad air yes the kindle guy uses an ipad for work i compared the viewing experience watching an episode of the lost ship read more
"UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th. I then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not I had made the right decision. Now that its finally been released and I have it in my hands, how different is it, and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price(My Kindle experience: I purchased my first Kindle (a first generation Paperwhite), when it was first released in Sept 2012.

"Okay, if you don't want to read my whole review, I'll summarize it right here: The Oasis is the most technologically advanced e-ink reader that Amazon - or anyone else, for that matter - has produced to date. But is it worth 290 for the least expensive version (wi-fi only with ads) In my opinion, the answer is no, not when the very capable Paperwhite is available for 100 (at the time I'm writing this). But I'm sure that there is a market for the Oasis, probably for the techno-geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the Oasis, and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading. But for the typical reader, I just don't think the Oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price, especially for those who already have a Paperwhite or Voyage.For reference, here's a brief comparison of the Oasis with the Paperwhite and the Voyage:Oasis (2016)-----------------------------Size: 5.6x4.8x0.13-0.33 (thickness varies)Weight (wi-fi version): 4.6 ounces (without battery case)Display: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED front-litStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus page turn buttonsNumber of fonts: 9Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lighting (10 LEDs)Third Generation Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more",5.0,B00ZS0G0PG,1,okay if you don t want to read my whole review i ll summarize it right here the oasis is the most technologically advanced e ink reader that amazon or anyone else for that matter has produced to date but is it worth for the least expensive version wi fi only with ads in my opinion the answer is no not when the very capable paperwhite is available for at the time i m writing this but i m sure that there is a market for the oasis probably for the techno geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the oasis and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading but for the typical reader i just don t think the oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price especially for those who already have a paperwhite or voyage for reference here s a brief comparison of the oasis with the paperwhite and the voyage oasis size x x thickness varies weight wi fi version ounces without battery case display diagonal pixels per inch level grayscale led front litstorage memory gbpage turns touchscreen plus page turn buttonsnumber of fonts display lighting manually adjustable front lighting leds third generation paperwhite size x x weight wi fi version read more
"I am a fairly voracious reader - 120+ books/year, almost all on Kindle. I have purchased every Kindle edition as soon as it was announced. The price doesn't bother me too much, as I figure with as much as I read, I make the money back by buying Kindle vs. hardcover books (since I mostly read new releases). This is the first Kindle that I sent back though.It's not that the Oasis isn't great - it is. The display is slightly crisper than previous Kindles. It's not that it isn't set up well - the buttons are placed well and easy to use, and the touch screen works fine. It's really just a matter of personal preference. I love to read while I have coffee in the morning and while I'm eating lunch at work, and because of that I love the origami case that the Voyage has. It's hard to read the Oasis hands-free, especially if you are used to the Voyage. Also, when reading while laying down, I switch hands unconsciously a couple of times a minute. I didn't realize this until I used the Oasis, because with the Oasis you have to flip the Kindle over, which may not seem like a big deal, but it definitely does not create a seamless reading experience.So if you like to read while eating or laying down then you are probably better off using the Voyage. If you want the best looking read, then the Oasis is great.

"I have owned literally (and I mean literally) every Kindle since the first one. All the keyboard versions that followed the first one, the Touch, the Paperwhite, the Voyage. All the Fires since the first one, all the different sizes from 10 to 6 and every gen in between. (I know, I am a little crazy.) Many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between Fires depending on mood. My last attempt was an iPad Mini, used only as an eReader, and for the first time in many years I bought books from somewhere other than Amazon, because I found the iBooks experience so pleasant. Bottom line... I was always seeking a Kindle that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more. Stop the press. I have found it.Lets put a little context around this. I eventually migrated to the Fires because although I liked the eInk for reading, I also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn't seem to offer that. The Paperwhite and it's successors got closer, so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory (something I have always done, even with real books).Still though, what I didn't like about the eInk versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line. I don't know whether it is just coincidence that I haven't seen that yet with the Oasis, or whether the Amazon Ember font helps (I like this new font a lot) or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer OS. Whatever, I have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an eReader.First impressions... not great.Read more",5.0,B00ZS0G0PG,1,i have owned literally and i mean literally every kindle since the first one all the keyboard versions that followed the first one the touch the paperwhite the voyage all the fires since the first one all the different sizes from to and every gen in between i know i am a little crazy many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between fires depending on mood my last attempt was an ipad mini used only as an ereader and for the first time in many years i bought books from somewhere other than amazon because i found the ibooks experience so pleasant bottom line i was always seeking a kindle that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more stop the press i have found it lets put a little context around this i eventually migrated to the fires because although i liked the eink for reading i also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn t seem to offer that the paperwhite and it s successors got closer so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory something i have always done even with real books still though what i didn t like about the eink versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line i don t know whether it is just coincidence that i haven t seen that yet with the oasis or whether the amazon ember font helps i like this new font a lot or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer os whatever i have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an ereader first impressions not great read more
"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. First of, let's start off by pointing out the obvious, it's under 100. You're not going to receive a Kindle Paperwhite. Before you order, read the specs and compare it to the other Kindles. Yes, the specs say it doesn't have backlighting so honestly, there shouldn't be one ounce of surprise when you receive this. I on the other hand, love this little Kindle. I have had the new Kindle Paperwhite and I really didn't like how big it was to hold in my small hands. I don't have children hands, but I'm a female and my hands are on the small side. Maybe for a male this would be kind of small, Idk. Anyway, it is smaller than the Paperwhite, but I love that. I also love the fact that it doesn't come with a light. I used to read at night with the Paperwhite, but that light gave me a headache so I stopped. It is NOT as dark as these bad reviews make it seem. You can read perfectly fine being indoors. They're exaggerating. This feels more like a book to me than the Kindle Paperwhite ever did. The letters on this Kindle are amazing. I don't even notice the difference between ppi and I love that the letters are way darker than the Paperwhite. The paperwhite had a grey hue to them and I didn't feel like I was reading a book. I felt like I actually holding a technical device to read a book. Of course since this doesn't have a backlight, you cannot read in the dark. It's common sense. If you want to read at night, purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindle. It's not a big deal and you're not going to break the bank buying a 119.99 item when you can buy this little awesome e-book reader for 79.99.

"There are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here, so I though I would add my positive one.I had a second-generation Kindle many years ago, and it has since stopped working. I finally decided to buy a new one.I chose the basic Kindle because that's exactly what I wanted -- a bare-bones e-reader. I have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort. This Kindle delivers on that front in every way possible.At first, I thought I would miss the page turn buttons, and dislike the touch screen. However, I have been delightfully surprised. Tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button, which was always a nice little jarring reminder that I wasn't, in fact, reading a paperback. The small, quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and I don't notice it anymore it feels natural.I do slightly miss the metal backing of the older Kindles it made them feel a bit sturdier, whereas this basic Kindle is just hard plastic. However, I suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably, and I feel that the cheaper price of this basic Kindle far outweighs that slight drawback.I bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers. I do not want ads intruding my Kindle experience, even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the Home screen. It is just distasteful to me, and the extra 30 was worth it to me to avoid the ads.I do not need or want a case for my Kindle. I do not like to read with a case on, and it would be cumbersome to remove my Kindle from its case every time I want to read.Read more",5.0,B01A08E70K,1,there are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here so i though i would add my positive one i had a second generation kindle many years ago and it has since stopped working i finally decided to buy a new one i chose the basic kindle because that s exactly what i wanted a bare bones e reader i have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort this kindle delivers on that front in every way possible at first i thought i would miss the page turn buttons and dislike the touch screen however i have been delightfully surprised tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button which was always a nice little jarring reminder that i wasn t in fact reading a paperback the small quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and i don t notice it anymore it feels natural i do slightly miss the metal backing of the older kindles it made them feel a bit sturdier whereas this basic kindle is just hard plastic however i suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably and i feel that the cheaper price of this basic kindle far outweighs that slight drawback i bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers i do not want ads intruding my kindle experience even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the home screen it is just distasteful to me and the extra was worth it to me to avoid the ads i do not need or want a case for my kindle i do not like to read with a case on and it would be cumbersome to remove my kindle from its case every time i want to read read more

"Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go.

"Since other people have gone into detail on the device, I will answer only the burning questions I had before I received mine. I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust. Settings/Device Options/Screen Light. I'm not actually sure that the night light is working.

"I've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. This review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.Size Weight---It's noticeably smaller and lighter than the Paperwhite. When I saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. The Voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the Paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.Origami Cover---I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).The other great new thing about this case is that the Voyage attaches to it magnetically. It attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the Paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. This is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.It's pricey but worth it.PagePress---One of the new features is PagePress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.Read more",3.0,B00PD81ETU,0,i ve got mixed feelings on this one unfortunately this review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the st generation size weight it s noticeably smaller and lighter than the paperwhite when i saw the specs it didn t really strike me as something that would make much difference to me but in real life it s actually great the voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into origami cover i know there s a separate product page for the origami cover but it s worth mentioning here as it is the official cover the origami cover is ugly and i was skeptical but i actually love it it s weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad this actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open in my opinion it s hard to describe but there are a lot more ways to hold the voyage when it s attached to this cover and just generally is more comfortable to use the origami part of the case works great as well it stands vertically or horizontally if you re laying down and reading this is amazing the other great new thing about this case is that the voyage attaches to it magnetically it attaches and detaches very easily unlike the paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case this is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light thin it is without a case attached it s super easy to take it out it s pricey but worth it pagepress one of the new features is pagepress which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages read more
"Updated 6/617 - so useful we now have 3 of these along with the full sized echo Amazon Echo - BlackAfter using the full sized Echo for a couple of months thought it would be nice to expand on that one piece of hardware. I had no experience with the 'Dot' so i went ahead and shopped for the refurbished (a first as well.) The Dot arrived in a small plain box. Upon removal found the Dot to look just like new.

"I was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit, but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up. I was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue. I have had this unit for about a month now, and it has worked perfectly since I received it. Like a brand new unit. If you can get this refurb for a substantial discount, I think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit.Edit (07/08/2017): My original refurb'ed Echo Dot is still going strong, and I received my second refurb'ed Echo Dot yesterday. This second one is just as like new as my first one. The packaging is similarly like new. It has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit, and I believe the power adapter, cable, and manuals are all actually brand new.",5.0,B06XDD27LJ,1,i was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up i was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue i have had this unit for about a month now and it has worked perfectly since i received it like a brand new unit if you can get this refurb for a substantial discount i think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit edit my original refurb ed echo dot is still going strong and i received my second refurb ed echo dot yesterday this second one is just as like new as my first one the packaging is similarly like new it has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit and i believe the power adapter cable and manuals are all actually brand new
"This was a birthday gift from my daughter. (71st birthday--certified old guy) What might I do with an Echo I bought a 3 Kindle book on using an Echo. Later I discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps, but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what I need to search out, and a Kindle book makes it easy for me to make notes I can find later with ease.I am using my Echo primarily as a radio. In the early 1990s I worked on my German skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio. Most of that is now on the Internet. I could listen on my smart phone, but that uses phone battery reserves. The Echo runs on AC power from a wall outlet. The little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts. I listen for hours to German news magazines. I can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from Radio Canada.We live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial. But, our WiFi reaches my garage workshop and I have clear audio through Tune In. (I am having trouble linking iHeart Radio, perhaps because my subscription is not paid.)When I have asked Alexa a question she sometimes tells me she cannot answer a question I thought simple enough.I did ask for some music and was surprised to find CDs I bought as gifts are in Amazon's cloud for me to hear over Echo.

"I'm totally enjoying my Echo Dot! I have it synced to my Google Calendar and am able to let Alexa tell me what's on the agenda for the day. I can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather. I also have it synced to my Pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to Pandora. I really wish I could just say shuffle my Pandora stations. That would be awesome! The speaker on the Dot isn't as loud as I would like it but if I'm sitting close by, it's good enough I guess. I've seen an option to add an external speaker but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet. And my 6 yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke! I live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of Alexa but I'm not regretting my purchase.",5.0,B06XDD27LJ,1,i m totally enjoying my echo dot i have it synced to my google calendar and am able to let alexa tell me what s on the agenda for the day i can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather i also have it synced to my pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to pandora i really wish i could just say shuffle my pandora stations that would be awesome the speaker on the dot isn t as loud as i would like it but if i m sitting close by it s good enough i guess i ve seen an option to add an external speaker but i haven t gotten around to doing that yet and my yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke i live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of alexa but i m not regretting my purchase
This is a nice compliment to my echo. Connected to my bt speaker it is actually a step up and less expensive than the echo.

"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more.

"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV.

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer.

I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently.

So very, very glad I bought it. Loads of stuff to watch. I have been able to catch up with some series I have missed, especially the BBC ones that I dearly love. I recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch. Along with my Amazon Prime most everything is FREE..that is an added bonus. Try it, you'll like it.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,wasn t sure how this would work with my rural dsl but it is wonderful i haven t had any problems with it at all it is easy to use and the voice command works just as they said it would so very very glad i bought it loads of stuff to watch i have been able to catch up with some series i have missed especially the bbc ones that i dearly love i recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch along with my amazon prime most everything is free that is an added bonus try it you ll like it
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more.

"I purchase almost everything with the exception of food from Amazon. I have been a prime member since the inception of the program. Without exception, I have always received EXCELLENT customer service. Until now. I'm having difficulty with my Fire TV connecting to my wifi. Last Saturday I spent approximately 1- hours (maybe 2) troubleshooting with two women techs on the phone. Mary (who I was passed to from the first tech because of her expertise) said she thought it wasn't just a problem unique to me and asked me if she could call me back on Sunday after researching the problem. I had no problem with that. No call on Sunday so I called on Monday. Much to my surprise, there was no record of my call attached to my file. The rep was confused as to whether I was talking about fire wire or Fire TV so I was first sent to a different department. Finally, I got through that fire wire was not the same as Fire TV and I was transferred back to digital. We went through the same troubleshooting taking up a lot of my time. I was willing to do it until we were going around in circles and my phone was running out of juice. The gentleman asked me if he could research and call me later in the day. NO CALL. It's Tuesday--still no call.It really pains me to have to say anything negative about Amazon's Customer Service as it has NEVER BEEN LESS THAN EXCELLENT IN THE PAST. I've noticed I haven't gotten a survey as I usually do after a customer service call. Whoever Amazon has farmed out their digital customer service to will ruin their excellent customer service reputation and they will lose sales because of it. I'm going to wager a bet that there is no record of the 3-4 hours of my time on the phone trying to solve a problem and no record of two promises to call me back. I would have had more respect for these reps if I had received a call saying they were sorry, but they weren't able to come up with a solution for me.I'm hoping Amazon has kept a record of my past reviews and will review my account and see just how much I've spent over the years as a loyal customer. I'm very disappointed that I had to write this review, and I'm hoping someone who can change things reads this and saves Amazon's reputation. I can't be the only one receiving this kind of treatment. It's obvious that the people who are techs for Fire TV are not the same techs that I've dealt with in the past. In fact, I don't think they are even in the same country.

It appears to be limited to Amazon content, at least for videos. I believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music.I am searching for House of Cards, Season 2, a Netflix original. I am a Netflix subscriber so I would expect the Netflix listing to be displayed but Fire TV only returns the show's Season 1 available for purchase at Amazon and does does not list Netflix at all. As a Netflix subscriber, I could watch both seasons 1 and 2 for free but, according to Fire TV's search, Season 2 doesn't exist and I'd have to pay 2.99 per episode if I wanted to watch Season 1.See how Roku's search (second half of video) correctly shows that Season 1 is available from Netflix, Amazon, MGo and Vudu and that I can gety get Season 2 from Netflix. It's also telling me (checkmarks) that I subscribe to 3 of the 4 services listed.It's up to everyone to weigh Amazon's faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns Amazon-only content vs. Roku's ability to find content across the channels/services it carries.REVIEW BEGINS HERE:As a current/former owner and user of streamers such as Roku 3, Roku Stick and Google's Chromecast and also streaming/gaming platforms such as PS3/PS4 and Xbox 360/One, I believe I can do a fair assessment on what Amazon's Fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives. I rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and, hopefully, my assessment of Amazon's Fire TV may help others decide whether this is what they need or want.BROAD ASSESSMENTThe Fire TV will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace. From what I've experienced so far, due to its tight integration with the Fire HDX tablets and Amazon's own Instant Video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the Amazon tablet and already subscribes to Amazon's Prime. Its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non-hard-core gamers. For everybody else, depending on one's specific needs and expectations, the Fire TV may or may not be the 'right' streamer to buy.As one who purchased Amazon's original Kindle Fire on day one and went through several generations of Amazon's Kindle reader I expect that Amazon's streamer will also evolve or grow overtime. Amazon will listen to 'us' and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting, 'new and improved', more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants. Until then, I would say that the current Fire TV is a competent, Amazon-content-biased (through search) streamer with gaming capabilities, lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search (offset by its currently favoring Amazon's service) and the user interface in general. Parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching. If all you want is streaming and don't care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don't need.CONTENTThe Fire TV offers most but not all mainstream services and I suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and I am sure that more services will be added in time. However, at this time Amazon's selection pales when compared to Roku's 1000+ wildly diverse channels but the Rokus have been around for a while. All mainstream services now on Fire TV are also available on Roku, PS3/4, Xbox 360/One and many on Google's Chromecast.Fire TV attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content, allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from Amazon's Instant Video. By comparison, Rokus offer text based cross-service search with results returned from most 'big' providers. Amazon's attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so, time will tell.The soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish Amazon's product from the competition once they are implemented.INNOVATIONAmazon's great innovative, revolutionary, disruptive device was the Kindle reader and the enhanced Kindle Paperwhite. I suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as 'forests' instead of 'recyclable material' these days because of the Kindle. Amazon's Fire tablets are nice but they are... tablets. The Fire TV streamer/gaming device falls probably under 'okay' or 'interesting' streamers and 'not too bad' gaming platforms.The quad-core CPU is also nice but, whether I'm streaming on a significantly more powerful PS4 or a tiny one-core CPU Chromecast, the video/audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable. I assume that the reason for a more powerful CPU is the game-playing part.The lack of large permanent storage (HDD) implies that, as a gaming platform, the Fire TV will allow for mostly small to medium-size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage. Again, a feature that may not be suitable for those whose ISPs charge by the Megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers.Game playing on the Fire TV works but those used with big console's lag-free controllers that 'rumble', talk back and sense motion may not view the Fire TV as a serious gaming platform.I would say that Amazon's streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation. It's a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that's still Okay.VALUEThere's very little that Amazon's Fire TV does that other platforms don't do.- The PS3/4 and the Xbox 360/One are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good streamers and multimedia machines. Only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more.- The Chromecast and the Rokus are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and PCs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet. They are also somewhat more difficult to setup.- Small streamers such as the Roku Stick and the Chromecast are very portable as they fit into one's shirt pocket. Amazon's Fire TV could be carried around at least in theory but it's not as easy to move around.- Roku is still the leader of 'content' but Amazon's selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time.- The Fire TV costs a lot more than a Roku or a Chromecast but, even if a gaming controller is added, is still less than a PS3 or an Xbox 360- Voice search as implemented on Fire TV at the time I am writing this (restricted to Amazon and Vevo) is in effect hiding content from other services, potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at Amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a 'free' stream.WHO NEEDS ITAnyone who already has one or more Roku, Chromecast or Xbox, Playstation in their homes probably don't need one at this time. Unless they are tightly integrated into Amazon's ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching.Those who are looking for their first streamer should consider- Fire TV's ease of use (beats the Chromecast but it's probably on par with Roku and the Xbox/Playstations)- Amazon's great user support- Roku's enormous channels selection- Playstation and Xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms (if you don't mind paying up to 60 for newly released games)- Amazon's attempt to keep their users confined to Amazon's own hardware platforms and content streams vs. Roku's and Chromecast relative openness- Fire TV's split gaming/streaming personality (Jack of 2 trades) vs. Roku's and Chromecast focus on streaming- Price, of courseIt's not an easy decision to make. I would be very happy with the Fire TV if it was the first streamer device in the house. With so many stream-capable and game-playing boxes/sticks already operating and doing well, I like Amazon's Fire TV for being a well designed, capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but I also like and I've been using the Rokus for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the Chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my Chrome browser to the TV. I hope that Amazon's search will soon expand to cover non-Amazon services or it won't be a useful tool. I may not have the the Fire TV attached to the big TV in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful Kindle and Amazon Prime user asked for it in her room.",3.0,B00CX5P8FC,0,a href

"The Fire TV came well packaged with extremely simple instructions. Plug in the power cable and HDMI cable (not included), put batteries in the remote and that's it. After initial start up there is an update that must be run, but after a few minutes the unit was up and running. Interface is nice looking and easy to use. Voice search worked perfectly...it understood this Kentucky accent instantly. Flipping through the movie choices is super fast (almost too fast since it has skipped a movie a time or two). Netflix is on the home page, but you have to install the app before using it the first time. As I'm typing this review the unit is displaying some beautiful screensaver pictures while I have a movie paused. If you store your photos on Amazon's Cloud you can use your own pictures instead. Picture quality is fantastic and movies start up lightning fast. The only thing I see as a con would be how the Prime movies are marked. The placement of the Prime marker in the upper left of the movie icon is very small and isn't as prominent as it should be making it rather difficult to tell whether it's Prime or a movie you would rent/purchase. I figure in the days and weeks ahead Amazon will be listening to customer suggestions (as they usually do) and more and more updates will be forthcoming making this device even better. For me the Amazon Fire TV is a winner. It will definitely be replacing a Directv receiver I was using.Update: After one full day of using Amazon's Fire TV I am more than satisfied with my purchase.If you read reviews like I do make sure to skip over the ones that don't have the Amazon Verified Purchase listed under their name or click that their post is unhelpful. These are people who are trying to review a product without even having it in their possession. If you discount those reviews (which make the overall rating less than it should be) you will discover that the majority of people who actually purchased this product are very satisfied.4-6-14 Update: Added the AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable and this has added a whole new dimension to the sound quality of my tv. The sounds are more richer and louder than ever before. I am continually amazed at what this little device is capable of. I really suggest getting the cable I mentioned above to make your Fire TV experience even better4-8-14 Update: Turned on the device today and went to start up Netflix...all I got was a white screen. Turned the unit off and on, but still a white screen. I uninstalled the Netflix app and reinstalled and it worked again. I don't believe it was a problem on the device itself, but rather the app since all of the other apps worked fine.4-15-14 Update: Had the same white screen issue with Netflix some more. Contacted customer service and reported the issue. He stepped me through the process of going into the settings then the apps. When you come to Netflix instead of uninstalling click on force stop. This fixed the issue. If I have the problem again he asked that I contact them back immediately so that they can contact the developers with the issue. I continue to enjoy this device and have since gotten rid of the Directv receiver I had connected. I can't recommend the Fire TV enough6-25-14 Update: My Fire TV is still going strong and I am completely happy with it. I have found that I watch TV more so on The Fire than my DirecTV. The one thing I haven't checked (but will sometime) is the USB port. I've got to save some movies to my flash drive and see if I can play a saved movie from the drive using the USB port on The Fire. Finding Amazon content is a breeze using the Voice Search and searching through movies or videos using Netflix and others is fine. Yes, it would be great to be able to use the Voice Search with everything else, but it's not a deal breaker for me nor an inconvenience. I would imagine Amazon will eventually include their Voice Search on any third party application as time allows. Even after using it all this time I'm still amazed at the sound and picture quality of such a tiny device. For me Amazon just gets better and better.8-4-14 Update: I had movies saved to an external hard drive and I plugged it into the USB port on the Amazon Fire, unfortunately, it doesn't work. It basically did nothing. It made no noise like it was trying to access my hard drive nor did it recognize any USB plugged in. Hopefully Amazon will push out an update to fix this at some point and time. It would be a wonderful feature to have.

"Here goes, I'm the 9 thousandth reviewer for this product LOL. short preface: I love Amazon, so when comparing all streaming devices in the end I went with the Fire TV because of the outstanding customer service, and it will improve with time. That being said, I share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have: I hate not being able to sort out the non Prime videos, I truly dislike paying for an episode (I didn't see that one coming, even though I did a ton of research). But overall I love my new cable bill, which only includes internet and basic, and I mean basic, service (15.00) because I'm reserving the right to order HBO and Showtime at some point. Was massively disappointed in Hulu Plus, because they don't offer the entire series in a show anymore (did they run out of server space or what) Netflix was a pleasant surprise. In case you are wondering, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill. And streaming is quite alright...after you get over the initial shock of not having live TV, although, ABC does do live TV hope the other stations follow suit soon. Overall, as a non tech person, it was ridiculously easy to hook this up, really anyone can do it. And like I said, if you're comparing other products, in the end Amazon cannot be beat for customer service or support.",4.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,here goes i m the thousandth reviewer for this product lol short preface i love amazon so when comparing all streaming devices in the end i went with the fire tv because of the outstanding customer service and it will improve with time that being said i share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have i hate not being able to sort out the non prime videos i truly dislike paying for an episode i didn t see that one coming even though i did a ton of research but overall i love my new cable bill which only includes internet and basic and i mean basic service because i m reserving the right to order hbo and showtime at some point was massively disappointed in hulu plus because they don t offer the entire series in a show anymore did they run out of server space or what netflix was a pleasant surprise in case you are wondering netflix hulu plus and prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill and streaming is quite alright after you get over the initial shock of not having live tv although abc does do live tv hope the other stations follow suit soon overall as a non tech person it was ridiculously easy to hook this up really anyone can do it and like i said if you re comparing other products in the end amazon cannot be beat for customer service or support

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Update 7/21/2014:The latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for Amazon Prime members - addressing most of my original complaints.Now that there is an entire section dedicated to Prime content, it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content. I wouldn't mind seeing more 'categories' to search through, but don't want to diminish the improvement.It's still not possible to search and return only Prime content. I think it should be possible to tell the device (when you search) that you only want returns from what is available for free to Prime members.The new 'Music' option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point. Not sure why it was added, but I hope it grows into a useful feature given the new Prime Music package.I would also like to see some sort of DLNA feature added. As one who rips all content that I buy (blu rays, dvds, cds) to a computer on my Network, I would very much like to be able to stream this material to the FireTV. Adding support for a connected USB device is not a solution for me. I have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material.

"First I would like to say that I am coming from using Google TV. Fire TV is a great device. The voice search is accurate at picking up what I say. My biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search. Coming from Google TV if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places. Lets say I am searching for the movie Gremlins. On Google TV it would look for it in Netflix, Amazon Instant, instant prime, Google play store, HBO Go, and you get the idea. This device for example will not check Netflix. So I must do a voice search to see if it is on Amazon, if not I must open lets say Netflix and use the up, down, left, right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on Netflix. That was the big issue for me. A small issue is the amount of apps. No HBO Go, Google play store, and others. I am not blaming amazon for this. It is an open system so HBO and others just need to make the apps for it. This devise is quick, and amazon items start up instantly, but not Netflix. Netflix must load first, but that is not a big deal. If you are wondering why I am switching from Google TV, it is because Google neglected it and it hasn't received updates in a long time. I think Google gave up on it.",4.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,first i would like to say that i am coming from using google tv fire tv is a great device the voice search is accurate at picking up what i say my biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search coming from google tv if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places lets say i am searching for the movie gremlins on google tv it would look for it in netflix amazon instant instant prime google play store hbo go and you get the idea this device for example will not check netflix so i must do a voice search to see if it is on amazon if not i must open lets say netflix and use the up down left right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on netflix that was the big issue for me a small issue is the amount of apps no hbo go google play store and others i am not blaming amazon for this it is an open system so hbo and others just need to make the apps for it this devise is quick and amazon items start up instantly but not netflix netflix must load first but that is not a big deal if you are wondering why i am switching from google tv it is because google neglected it and it hasn t received updates in a long time i think google gave up on it
"I own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the Amazon Fire TV falls into more of the apple tv category. It's definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon's prime tv offerings. You can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than On Demand options available from your cable provider.However, for your prime investment, there are no free titles. I'd love to see Amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles. The price barrier keeps me from watching older titles, but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it.The interface is great. I find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use. It's really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available.Performance is best in class as the Fire TV has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider. I'd love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment. However, for an all-in-one, solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot.I use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great. Certainly, there's no blu-ray player that can match the capability of this device.All-in-all I definitely recommend this device to anyone, but still prefer the Roku since Roku isn't selling its own content service, so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn't even know existed.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,i own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the amazon fire tv falls into more of the apple tv category it s definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon s prime tv offerings you can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than on demand options available from your cable provider however for your prime investment there are no free titles i d love to see amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles the price barrier keeps me from watching older titles but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it the interface is great i find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use it s really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available performance is best in class as the fire tv has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider i d love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment however for an all in one solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot i use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great certainly there s no blu ray player that can match the capability of this device all in all i definitely recommend this device to anyone but still prefer the roku since roku isn t selling its own content service so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn t even know existed
"I already have 2 Roku devices, but thought I would give this new Amazon device a try. This device works fine for the Amazon Instant video app, but there is a terrible lag in the video on the Netflix app that makes it unusable on this device. I know this issue is not my internet connection as the Netflix app works great on the Roku devices. In addition, the user interface on this device is generally just not that great. Wish I could get a refund and get another roku box.",1.0,B00CX5P8FC,0,i already have roku devices but thought i would give this new amazon device a try this device works fine for the amazon instant video app but there is a terrible lag in the video on the netflix app that makes it unusable on this device i know this issue is not my internet connection as the netflix app works great on the roku devices in addition the user interface on this device is generally just not that great wish i could get a refund and get another roku box
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay 150-400+ extra for features that are found in these 100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it)HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time.Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky.(You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.)Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are.Amazon's Fire TV boxPros:+ Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster.+ Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example.+ Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40. The 40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be 25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a REAL console at 100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them.+ Better image quality I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with decent quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex.Cons:- It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it.- The interface is more than merely cold. It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use.- The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix.- The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion.- Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned.- No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature.- Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch.- Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information.Overall:This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40 more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value.If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks)If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box.I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements.If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 Fire TV.I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3.I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them.UPDATE 1:Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points.Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc.I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone.HBO Go:This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it.UPDATE 2:CHANNELS:It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature.NETFLIX APP: Is the older style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the new Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3.Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app.AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a feature they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going.VOICE SEARCH:Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results.OPTICAL OUT:I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box).Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected.VEVO APP:This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too.REMOTE:I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first peopleI do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys. This is the way it used to be on Roku boxes before someone at Roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it.MULTITASKING:What multitasking you ask Since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, I can understand your confusion but try this: Load a Pandora stream...then click on the HOME button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. As long as you are in the Home/Amazon Prime content, you can browse WHILE Pandora continues playing. Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here)Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist.PLEX APP:Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see. I do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click).SCREENSAVER:FireTV has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. I am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) This functionality covers 3rd party apps like Netflix and Plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. This is the sort of thing you see on PCs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch.GAME CHANGING:Many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title.I said Nothing else is this fast to which one commenter said, Nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. That's not a game changerActually using it you will see what I mean. This is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device. Like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities.When AMD created their first processor that competed directly with Intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc.People will look back in 5 years at this moment and say Amazon's FireTV changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with HTPCs and Mac Minis). This is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes.I said Voice search is amazing. and they said Not unique, by any means. My xbox, ps3, tablets, all have this, and all work amazingly.Find one person who owns this that doesn't say this voice search works better than anything from Google, Apple or Microsoft. The fact that little old Amazon could out deliver those tech giants is SHOCKING. The fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to. There is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost.I said Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40 to which they said: And stick to basic android games. No thanks. I have a REAL console (or a couple of them) that can play REAL games...This isn't meant to compete with more expensive game consoles. It is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes, just like tablets/cellphones have brought gaming to millions. They have not replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you CAN'T play on that same console. Just imagine all the cheap under 5/free games you can enjoy on your FireTV box. As I said above in my main review, I think Amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but I can understand why they needed to limit their losses.Again, this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device (and the only one for a streaming video box). Every future streaming box will be measured against this one. Tell me how that isn't game changingPlease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone. I am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them.Hopefully this review has been helpful to you.

is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdtv are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than firetv roku apple tv but if you can live with the short comings it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes normally you pay extra for features that are found in these boxes i have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting the advantage is that you can use your tv remote to access the content and that is about it htpc these are desktop computers or mac minis or android sticks that you load software on to stream video to your tv these can add content that no normal streaming box can access without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn t mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time video game consoles xbox playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams the downside is the cost unless you already have one and the interfaces these consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky you can use other options but frankly they aren t worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do now this amazon product has changed everything it might not be the box for you but honestly there is a good chance that it should be this is a brand new category for amazon and they got a lot right but there are a few shortcomings at least at launch as well so read all of this to see what those are amazon s fire tv boxpros nothing else is this fast while roku impressed the world this raises the bar dramatically with a quad core processor and times the memory of any other streaming product it speeds through menus boots quicker starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times the best way i can explain it you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is that much faster voice search is amazing it really works less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn t done before but it is only for amazon content and vevo music videos at least for now you can not use the voice search with netflix for example ready for gaming well at least once you spend another the gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be or less in my opinion that being said this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a very limited selection on roku but it is not a real console at and honestly shouldn t be compared to them better image quality i know you are thinking i am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally in different apps the video is slightly sharper and clearer we are using the exact same tv settings even the same hdmi cable that we used with the roku until we switched it for the fire tv box we have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with roku now i don t know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something as image quality is a huge deal for most folks and normally us streamers have to suffer with decent quality this is certainly worth noting so far we have noticed this under netflix vevo and plex cons it lacks soul yes soul the fire tv box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance cold fast efficient unlike roku where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of tivo it feels warmer more inviting everything about this box is business like including the interface and the lack of options to change it the interface is more than merely cold it is simply less flashy pretty than the roku interface while fast i am less tempted to wander around like i do on roku it seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the roku interface i will update this more upon extended use the voice search only works for amazon s own content and vevo and not most rd party channels like netflix the remote is not ready for gaming use compared to the roku remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements motion another feature about the remote i don t care for is the use of bluetooth instead of wifi roku used to use bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote it will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned no headphone jack function like roku now to be honest if you use that on the roku it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature missing some popular channels at launch there is no hbo go no m go and no vudu in addition the channel count is much less than roku s at launch channels operate differently on firetv than the do on roku see my notes below for more information overall this fire tv box took so much from other company s products with only a few missing items they focused on delivering smooth fast performance with less frills than roku for the same price while there are missing channels and features the biggest failure for me personally is the cost of the gaming controller without it this box isn t ready for gaming but adding more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep had amazon included it with every fire tv box they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the roku a poor value if you do not have any streaming box yet i would highly recommend this box over every other product on the market right now i don t make this endorsement lightly i currently own roku boxes because i liked them so much until i used this fire tv box this box means roku will have to really work on improving their product for roku or they will lose the high end market an update my wife officially asked to replace the roku boxes with more fire tv boxes tonight yes these things are that good folks if you have a roku box really look at the missing channels and features are they something you could give up for faster performance also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps if the answer is yes then grab one of these and try it if no wait to see if amazon adds features channels at the very least consider an fire tv box for your next box i do not personally recommend apple tv as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements if you are on a budget and have an android based tablet consider chromecast it is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to roku fire tv i am giving this box a rating compared to a for roku i will update this review regularly for a while so check back for more information also if you have questions or comments please feel free to ask them in the comments section either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them update based on comments i wanted to add a few points regarding comments that i received the item free or are paid by amazon to write this review etc i paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box grrr nothing was provided to me nor was i paid anything to write about this device i do not work for amazon i own my own company for this item i am just a customer in fact i didn t expect to even purchase a fire tv prior to it being announced because i figured it would only deal with amazon s own content which i feel is much weaker than netflix in fact i have talked two different family members into getting netflix over amazon s prime streaming service in the past month alone hbo go this has been repeated over and over in the comments but hbo go support for me is not something i am interested in as i do not have cable service anymore nor do i feel that hbo is a better value than netflix i would not go without netflix support at all but i personally think hbo go is more niche for many people and honestly i bet this device will get that channel before too long clearly the hbo go people seem to be pushing the issue but i know streaming box users and none use hbo go so while i noted the missing feature above people still seem to want to beat me up over it update channels it needs to be said that some channels require cable satellite subscriptions to those channels like hbo go not currently on this box showtime espn etc even if you have hbo it does not mean that your provider allows the hbo go so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind i do like the bloomberg tv not available on roku app which actually features a live tv feature netflix app is the older style with the tall covers like vhs boxes instead of the new netflix interface that uses short wide covers like on roku netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the fire tv box doesn t have it yet that makes comparing performance harder from roku to fire tv on my isp provider comcast netflix recently agreed to pay comcast so they have faster streams to customers i do not see a huge improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels what it does seem to do is start in better quality and or speed the improvement in quality my guess is that the netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware one positive with the firetv app is that it plays the entire tv episode before switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode i can t tell you how many times i had to click click click and click just to see the end of an episode under roku also the firetv netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated roku app before going into a tv show firetv tells you how many total episodes that netflix has on the roku it shows you the number of seasons instead i personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference another point worth mentioning is that the firetv netflix app shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on that information is missing from the roku netflix app amazon prime content does not loop a feature they should add and likely will this means once you get to the end it just stops instead of keeping going voice search voice search does cover some rd party content despite everyone reporting it works on amazon s content only i have repeated confirmed it supports the vevo app and will find music videos in that app that may mean that other rd party apps are covered as well or certainly might be able to be in the future if you search for something that has prime content and vevo content it will default to the option with the most options to switch to the other simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or prime search results optical out i noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my lg tv via hdmi and then use an optical out to my receiver so i never have to change the receiver s settings so i wasn t excited about this addition to the fire tv box over my roku boxes i stand corrected i decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this fire tv box something that i can not do with roku and it fixed all random lip sync issues i have from time to time on the roku box and the same with the hdmi output on this box now i know this is not a typical setup for many people but i do know that tons of people have lip sync issues with hdmi connections so being able to bypass the hdmi minefield is much more important than i expected vevo app this app works better than the roku app performance wise one quick example is that some content simply fails on the roku app try watching britney spears s work b ch don t make fun of me vevo can play this video fine on youtube and on the fire tv app but struggles on roku s app some of vevo s content is also available via voice search too remote i do miss the jump back button on the remote that roku features it is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn t hear because the phone rang or someone was talking you feel lost without it update they did include this feature but hid it abit you simply double click the reward button to skip back i haven t seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first peoplei do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys this is the way it used to be on roku boxes before someone at roku decided to move it below the directional keys so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it multitasking what multitasking you ask since you haven t seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere i can understand your confusion but try this load a pandora stream then click on the home button and browse for movies tv you want to watch as long as you are in the home amazon prime content you can browse while pandora continues playing now pandora dies when you enter another app like netflix but it shows you that multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features again this tip is only found here another update this tip also works when browsing plex content before you play something so even when utilizing a rd party app it can keep going when it changes to a new song a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist plex app compared to the roku app plex for firetv is totally different there are some cool features like the backgrounds the screensaver using your photos and the much faster menuing night and day from roku but i do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to online to see i do miss that clicking the play button doesn t play a clip instead you select it click and then play it second click screensaver firetv has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion i am not saying you can t do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well this functionality covers rd party apps like netflix and plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts this is the sort of thing you see on pcs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch game changing many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title i said nothing else is this fast to which one commenter said nobody cares how fast an streaming box is that s not a game changeractually using it you will see what i mean this is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device like a fast computer which this basically is it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities when amd created their first processor that competed directly with intel s higher end processors it was a game changer correct because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever lowered pricing etc people will look back in years at this moment and say amazon s firetv changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made instead of barely enough processing power to stream they became able to compete with htpcs and mac minis this is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes i said voice search is amazing and they said not unique by any means my xbox ps tablets all have this and all work amazingly find one person who owns this that doesn t say this voice search works better than anything from google apple or microsoft the fact that little old amazon could out deliver those tech giants is shocking the fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to there is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost i said ready for gaming well at least once you spend another to which they said and stick to basic android games no thanks i have a real console or a couple of them that can play real games this isn t meant to compete with more expensive game consoles it is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes just like tablets cellphones have brought gaming to millions they have not replaced gaming consoles and likely never will just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you can t play on that same console just imagine all the cheap under free games you can enjoy on your firetv box as i said above in my main review i think amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but i can understand why they needed to limit their losses again this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device and the only one for a streaming video box every future streaming box will be measured against this one tell me how that isn t game changingplease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone i am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them hopefully this review has been helpful to you if so please let me know by clicking the button below remember you don t have to agree with everything i said to think it was helpful read more
"I was really looking forward to using what was hyped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment, but the actual experience falls short.Pros:+ User interface and underlying hardware is fast+ Form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek+ Plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box+ Quality of Amazon videos is very good+ Voice search works quite well+ The device came pre-configured for my Amazon account. I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I wentCons:- First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime.- Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies- Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example- The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.UPDATE:I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say Recently added to Prime and Top Prime Movies. Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people. OF COURSE IT IS. I don't want to pay for video rentals if I just paid for a Prime membership to access free content. AMAZON COMPLETELY FAILED.

"I am sooo impressed with Amazon Fire TV. Believe it or not, I sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good. It is like taking a trip around the world. The amount of things you can do with this Fire TV is pretty incredible to me. There is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive. There is a massive amount of things to watch, both free with Prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy. I am glad I made this purchase. This unit is so small I will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any TV with the HDMI and keep up with my favorite shows.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,i am sooo impressed with amazon fire tv believe it or not i sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good it is like taking a trip around the world the amount of things you can do with this fire tv is pretty incredible to me there is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive there is a massive amount of things to watch both free with prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy i am glad i made this purchase this unit is so small i will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any tv with the hdmi and keep up with my favorite shows
"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,i m your typical middle aged woman i don t game and i m not super tech savvy by any means so take this review for what it is the fire tv was easy to install and i m loving all the features free movies music and simple interface this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you re listening to music we ve always just had our comcast cable service without dvr and occasionally used comcast ondemand to watch rent movies but i ll never watch from comcast again the voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what i was looking for every single time i searched it s just so easy to find what you re looking for unlike comcast and since i m an amazon prime member most of what i want to view is free oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from amazon is on average cheaper than comcast ondemand by a or more so happy with this purchase
"In addition to the Fire TV, I have an Apple TV as well as a ChromeCast. By far and large, the best product is the Fire TV. I use it more than both the other ones combined. Having integration between my Prime list and the device is clutch, as I consume media across several different devices.I do wish I could search by Prime Instant, so I hope they will fix that. I also wish I could cast a Prime Instant streaming video from a device to the Fire TV, but I don't see that as an option (although I can cast YouTube to my Fire TV, which is really cool).There is no doubt that it is faster than both Apple TV and ChromeCast, and the voice recognition is SO convenient. I also have the game controller, and the games are pretty good. I don't game much, but I wanted to check it out. I was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement.I'd also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this (both ChromeCast and Apple TV have this). From an educator's standpoint, this could be the 100 solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers (Apple TV doesn't play well with enterprise level security, and ChromeCast doesn't do well with some software that is essential for instruction).All in all, it's my favorite media device. It's faster, has a great and snappy UI, and is easy to setup.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,in addition to the fire tv i have an apple tv as well as a chromecast by far and large the best product is the fire tv i use it more than both the other ones combined having integration between my prime list and the device is clutch as i consume media across several different devices i do wish i could search by prime instant so i hope they will fix that i also wish i could cast a prime instant streaming video from a device to the fire tv but i don t see that as an option although i can cast youtube to my fire tv which is really cool there is no doubt that it is faster than both apple tv and chromecast and the voice recognition is so convenient i also have the game controller and the games are pretty good i don t game much but i wanted to check it out i was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement i d also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this both chromecast and apple tv have this from an educator s standpoint this could be the solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers apple tv doesn t play well with enterprise level security and chromecast doesn t do well with some software that is essential for instruction all in all it s my favorite media device it s faster has a great and snappy ui and is easy to setup

"It seems to work fine so far (2 Days with it). What I don't like is how Amazon has made it so thePrime content is mixed with the For Pay content, with no easy way to just see what is ONLY Prime content. This is obviously made to divert you into buying more non Prime content...Amazon, please give us a CLEAR way to view Prime Only if that's what we want. I know we can voice search for anything... and that's great, but sometimes we just want to Go Fishing and would like to fish in the Prime pond only. This is a pretty big deal when you compare this to competing (Think ROKU) products that let you do just that.Hard to believe your competition does a better job with presenting your own content than you do.

"This is a wonderful streaming device. I have been an Apple TV man since 2008, but I have decided that I just might never return to my Apple TV. I have used/owned all 3 generations and have known them inside and out (unlocked my 1st generation for secret stuff. Shhhh) and swore by them for years. I just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch. Voice command is a nice touch, but I was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor. No more waiting for my videos to buffer, and this is especially important in my house where my wife, kids, and I are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos. Final word: If you're just looking for a great device to stream both Netflix and Amazon Prime, then you've found the right streamer.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,this is a wonderful streaming device i have been an apple tv man since but i have decided that i just might never return to my apple tv i have used owned all generations and have known them inside and out unlocked my st generation for secret stuff shhhh and swore by them for years i just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch voice command is a nice touch but i was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor no more waiting for my videos to buffer and this is especially important in my house where my wife kids and i are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos final word if you re just looking for a great device to stream both netflix and amazon prime then you ve found the right streamer
"I got mine from an electronics store, because I didn't want to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Setup was a breeze. I don't have cable, so prior to this, I had to hook my laptop up to my TV to enjoy Prime and Netflix content on it. I'm also really pleased that they added a YouTube app That was the number one drawback for me when considering this device. From what I've read, I figured I'd sideload one, but they saved me the trouble.Once I signed in to YouTube and linked my mobile devices, I even gained the ability to send content to my TV for viewing I don't have a Fire phone or Kindle (although I do have a Paperwhite), so I'm not able to comment on the connectivity with those.I can't say enough good things about this tiny box. I've had it for a couple of months and use it every day The user interface is intuitive and efficient. I really love the screen saver pictures, too. Most of them are breathtaking, and they seem to update periodically. The voice search is very accurate. There are a decent amount of apps for added content. I mostly stick to the abovementioned sources, but I added Crackle for a bit of variety.My only complaint would be about the rewind/fast forward. It's not intuitive, and takes some getting used to. I don't use that feature often, so it's no biggie to me.I did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first, but I got used to that, too. Just make sure to press the Home button when you're done for the evening or whatever, because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something, it won't go to sleep. It remembers your place in whatever you were watching, so no worries about that.I look forward to continued software improvements, and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon, so I can try out the games.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,i got mine from an electronics store because i didn t want to wait for it to arrive in the mail setup was a breeze i don t have cable so prior to this i had to hook my laptop up to my tv to enjoy prime and netflix content on it i m also really pleased that they added a youtube app that was the number one drawback for me when considering this device from what i ve read i figured i d sideload one but they saved me the trouble once i signed in to youtube and linked my mobile devices i even gained the ability to send content to my tv for viewing i don t have a fire phone or kindle although i do have a paperwhite so i m not able to comment on the connectivity with those i can t say enough good things about this tiny box i ve had it for a couple of months and use it every day the user interface is intuitive and efficient i really love the screen saver pictures too most of them are breathtaking and they seem to update periodically the voice search is very accurate there are a decent amount of apps for added content i mostly stick to the abovementioned sources but i added crackle for a bit of variety my only complaint would be about the rewind fast forward it s not intuitive and takes some getting used to i don t use that feature often so it s no biggie to me i did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first but i got used to that too just make sure to press the home button when you re done for the evening or whatever because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something it won t go to sleep it remembers your place in whatever you were watching so no worries about that i look forward to continued software improvements and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon so i can try out the games
"This review is to try to offset some of Roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device.The first thing you notice after plugging everything in, is a 3-5 minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass, even if you know your way around these types of devices. You will only see it once, and then you're good to go. The device is small and beautiful. The remote is better than any other device, including Roku 3, and my WD TV Live.First the PROs:- It's the fastest media streamer, by far. That's not only a good thing if you own one, but it will force Roku and other companies to stop skimping on the hardware, and firmware updating.- The menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver. You can't move things around yet, but I'm sure they will eventually let you customize your own page. As of now, the apps (which would be at the top, if I could change it) are at the bottom. Apps are larger and higher resolution than the Roku.- The voice button is amazing. For a first attempt, they almost got it right. I understand this is a proprietary device, so they will always want you to use Amazon instant video for your viewing. But this option should search for all of your linked accounts, including Hulu, Netflix, etc. I'm not sure that they will ever fix this, because they will lose money and viewers. Even so, it's still a PRO, because it does work well.- Streaming quality - WOW Everything I've tried buffers so quickly, that it's almost already at 1080p when it starts playing. With my Roku, Netflix looks great, but it takes 5-10 seconds to get there. I currently have 100Mbps of internet, so I'm not sure what everyone else goes through, but I can tell you this streams better than Roku. Period.- Overheating and reboots - My Roku 3 cannot handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs. It gets exhausted, and it has to reset itself. This device is more powerful, and after using it all day today, I can say my Roku 3 will be immediately up for sale, once they add the Time Warner Cable and HBOgo apps.-- PLEX -- Okay, I always blamed my Plex for the long delays on my Roku. With my internet speeds, I could never understand why it was always loading at 1080p settings, regardless of the bitrate. Anyway, I was wrong. It's the device. Not only does the Fire TV have a much better PLEX app (which is beautiful, btw), but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds. No re-loading (buffering) during movie playback. And the movies are in a much nicer grid layout, so I don't have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection.Now the CONS:- Obviously it's still missing some apps. You are crazy if you think HBOgo will go much longer without being added. The same for other apps. They built it, so they WILL come.- Interface - it is nice, but as I stated in the PROs, you can't make changes to it, hopefully just for now. If it stays this way, it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps.- One major issue that is very upsetting to me, is the fact that they couldn't add two very important things - USB 3.0, and 802.11ac. If Amazon claims they were listening, they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience. I haven't plugged my WD 4TB hard to it yet, but it is a 3.0 hard drive. Now it will unfortunately revert to 2.0 speeds. Don't build a supposedly forward-thinking device with two things that are now considered dated. I have a feeling this was done to make money off the Fire TV 2. Thanks for that.Overall, it is the best device currently available, and they really made the experience fun. It does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service. Buy it...you will not regret it.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,this review is to try to offset some of roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device the first thing you notice after plugging everything in is a minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass even if you know your way around these types of devices you will only see it once and then you re good to go the device is small and beautiful the remote is better than any other device including roku and my wd tv live first the pros it s the fastest media streamer by far that s not only a good thing if you own one but it will force roku and other companies to stop skimping on the hardware and firmware updating the menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver you can t move things around yet but i m sure they will eventually let you customize your own page as of now the apps which would be at the top if i could change it are at the bottom apps are larger and higher resolution than the roku the voice button is amazing for a first attempt they almost got it right i understand this is a proprietary device so they will always want you to use amazon instant video for your viewing but this option should search for all of your linked accounts including hulu netflix etc i m not sure that they will ever fix this because they will lose money and viewers even so it s still a pro because it does work well streaming quality wow everything i ve tried buffers so quickly that it s almost already at p when it starts playing with my roku netflix looks great but it takes seconds to get there i currently have mbps of internet so i m not sure what everyone else goes through but i can tell you this streams better than roku period overheating and reboots my roku cannot handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs it gets exhausted and it has to reset itself this device is more powerful and after using it all day today i can say my roku will be immediately up for sale once they add the time warner cable and hbogo apps plex okay i always blamed my plex for the long delays on my roku with my internet speeds i could never understand why it was always loading at p settings regardless of the bitrate anyway i was wrong it s the device not only does the fire tv have a much better plex app which is beautiful btw but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds no re loading buffering during movie playback and the movies are in a much nicer grid layout so i don t have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection now the cons obviously it s still missing some apps you are crazy if you think hbogo will go much longer without being added the same for other apps they built it so they will come interface it is nice but as i stated in the pros you can t make changes to it hopefully just for now if it stays this way it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps one major issue that is very upsetting to me is the fact that they couldn t add two very important things usb and ac if amazon claims they were listening they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience i haven t plugged my wd tb hard to it yet but it is a hard drive now it will unfortunately revert to speeds don t build a supposedly forward thinking device with two things that are now considered dated i have a feeling this was done to make money off the fire tv thanks for that overall it is the best device currently available and they really made the experience fun it does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service buy it you will not regret it
"After having the FireTV for about a month now, I can confidently recommend this product for most people. Versus the current generation Apple TV, ChromeCast and Roku offerings, the FireTV is the best value due to it's access to a wide variety of content, build quality and advanced features. It's a device I have recommended to my (almost-elderly) parents my (geeky) friends.Best things about the FireTV: - It is fast - unlike the Roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product - Has Amazon Prime Video access- if you have prime membership, this is the best accessory you can buy. Lots of great content from Comedy Central and newer movies versus Netflix. - An AppStore with apps games you actually want - Plex Showtime AnyTime are the big difference makers IMO. - If you have local video files on your network, Plex is the way to go. - Voice searchWorst things about the FireTV (which really aren't that bad): - Annoying/long intro video upon the first time you boot up - Larger power adapter versus Apple TV (Yes the little things count) - No HBOGO until late 2014 - Going to be a problem from the folks looking for their Game of Thrones fix this spring** - No chromecast/airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet**If you don't need HBOGO right now and don't have a bunch of apple products, stop reading this right now and buy this device. You won't regret it.** See below for ways around thisIf you are an advanced user and/or are on the fence this next section is for you.Before the FireTV, I had 3 Apple Tv 2's in my house that I used to access HBOGO, Hulu+, Netflix my local media through the infuse application. I had tried Roku's, ChromeCast and other media boxes/home theater pc's and the Apple TV worked best for me. While this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks - lack of 1080p video, limited app selection, no games, etc.... Which led me to trying the FireTV.Because the FireTV is based on android, android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine. The steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your FireTV. You may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy - you'll need them to get a few things running. Any old usb keyboard/mouse you have lying around should work OK.(The following links provide the best directions I have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too, but no promises)How to sideload applications to the FireTV:1. The first step in loading android apps is getting ADB set up on your machine can be done by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/connecting-adb2. After that, you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications, also by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/sdk/asb/app-install.html3. If you aren't comfortable with working with the command line, and are running windows, you can try this great GUI application to automatically side load applications. - forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.phpt2736740Once you are able to send android apps (.apk) files to the FireTV, I recommend:1. Installing MXPlayer to allow .MKV .AVI video file playback: sites.google.com/site/mxvpen/download2. If your network drive/computer doesn't support plex, try using ESFileExplorer to navigate to play back video files - appsapk.com/es-file-explorer/3. AirReceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv. Please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds. This is a paid app, buy play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.softmedia.receiver4. HBOGO android app can be installed and works rather well. It does require a mouse to navigate.5. XBMC - If you know what this, you will want it and yes it works. Download via xbmc.orgFor the cord cutters out there, I've tried installing Aereo Slingbox with mixed results. Slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok. Using the mouse I was able to accept the terms conditions and input my user info. Unfortunately it doesn't load the video stream. Other folks have had success apparently, so it may be just me. Aereo side loads opens fine but I couldn't sign up for a trial as I am 1 town over from being in their current market area. I will update this review if I get any further with either.There are many more apps you may want to try so check out this comprehensive list of app functionality from the reddit.com/r/firetv folks - docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uD6cesLVtHwsoWDE9jlKsV9FtlUbQ3KvDQp6N9gbHE/editgid1337307432This list includes information on emulators roms which I didn't include in this review due to their dubious legality.",5.0,B00CX5P8FC,1,after having the firetv for about a month now i can confidently recommend this product for most people versus the current generation apple tv chromecast and roku offerings the firetv is the best value due to it s access to a wide variety of content build quality and advanced features it s a device i have recommended to my almost elderly parents my geeky friends best things about the firetv it is fast unlike the roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product has amazon prime video access if you have prime membership this is the best accessory you can buy lots of great content from comedy central and newer movies versus netflix an appstore with apps games you actually want plex showtime anytime are the big difference makers imo if you have local video files on your network plex is the way to go voice searchworst things about the firetv which really aren t that bad annoying long intro video upon the first time you boot up larger power adapter versus apple tv yes the little things count no hbogo until late going to be a problem from the folks looking for their game of thrones fix this spring no chromecast airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet if you don t need hbogo right now and don t have a bunch of apple products stop reading this right now and buy this device you won t regret it see below for ways around thisif you are an advanced user and or are on the fence this next section is for you before the firetv i had apple tv s in my house that i used to access hbogo hulu netflix my local media through the infuse application i had tried roku s chromecast and other media boxes home theater pc s and the apple tv worked best for me while this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks lack of p video limited app selection no games etc which led me to trying the firetv because the firetv is based on android android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine the steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your firetv you may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy you ll need them to get a few things running any old usb keyboard mouse you have lying around should work ok the following links provide the best directions i have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too but no promises how to sideload applications to the firetv the first step in loading android apps is getting adb set up on your machine can be done by following amazon s directions developer amazon com appsandservices solutions devices fire tv docs connecting adb after that you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications also by following amazon s directions developer amazon com sdk asb app install html if you aren t comfortable with working with the command line and are running windows you can try this great gui application to automatically side load applications forum xda developers com showthread phpt once you are able to send android apps apk files to the firetv i recommend installing mxplayer to allow mkv avi video file playback sites google com site mxvpen download if your network drive computer doesn t support plex try using esfileexplorer to navigate to play back video files appsapk com es file explorer airreceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds this is a paid app buy play google com store apps detailsidcom softmedia receiver hbogo android app can be installed and works rather well it does require a mouse to navigate xbmc if you know what this you will want it and yes it works download via xbmc orgfor the cord cutters out there i ve tried installing aereo slingbox with mixed results slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok using the mouse i was able to accept the terms conditions and input my user info unfortunately it doesn t load the video stream other folks have had success apparently so it may be just me aereo side loads opens fine but i couldn t sign up for a trial as i am town over from being in their current market area i will update this review if i get any further with either there are many more apps you may want to try so check out this comprehensive list of app functionality from the reddit com r firetv folks docs google com spreadsheets d ud ceslvthwsowde jlksv ftlubq kvdqp n gbhe editgid this list includes information on emulators roms which i didn t include in this review due to their dubious legality

"This was SO easy to set up. We were up running in less than 10 minutes and WOW. This is primarily my hubby's toy (I play on the computer, he flies the TV). Voice search is SUCH a timesaver. I used to have to stop whatever I was doing to type in whatever he needed to search for. NOW, HE CAN HANDLE IT. Speak and ye shall FIND. Love, love, love this boxThe speed of the video loading is awesome, as is the intuitive search function (Amazon KNOWS what he likes, so his lists are more or less pre-filtered so they load faster).I waffled for WEEKS before buying this. I read tons of reviews finally decided it would be worth the temporary (Honey, HOW DO I DO THIS) change in look, feel, etc. (we've been streaming with a Roku since about 2009 had the Roku XD for a long time, just before the change to FireTV).Finally, I decided to try it, thinking if Hubby had too much difficulty adapting, we'd just send it back (while also TRUSTING AMAZON to have made a massive leap forward--have never, myself, been disappointed with any of their electronic offerings).I was expecting to have to sync it with our router, sign on to our accounts again and again (Amazon, Netflix, etc.).NOPE. Plug it in.It turned itself ON.Updated ITSELF.FOUND my router.Was PRE-LOADED with my Amazon account.We were from box to watching in under 10 minutes (there's even a 2 or 3 minute cartoon TUTORIAL that teaches you everything you need to know to stream use your remote--easy breezy).When he wanted to try Netflix, he was able to EASILY click to install an app, then I *painfully* used a grid-keyboard to logon to Netflix account (username pwd) only ONCE and we were DONE.The voice search is SUCH a leap forward. It's incredible AND accurate. Can voice search by title, genre, director, actor, everything. And it even understands SOUTHERN. WooHooIt has 4 times the processing speed and 4 times the memory of our previous Roku box WOW what a difference in loadtime, resolution, quality of picture/vividness of color. Just awesome. What can I say Amazon did it again.Movie/Program descriptions are displayed at the bottom of the screen ( my ONLY quibbling complaint is you can't change the font size on descriptions w/o altering TV resolution, which I won't do). They do have excellent Closed Captioning functionality for those who need it you can enlarge the fonts there for easy readability.Basically, I'm very happy we took the plunge it really was a worthwhile improvement for us (we prefer Amazon's video streaming anyway--they have lots more documentaries than the other streaming services).I'm just sorry I waited so long : )---------Quick Update:Not all apps come preloaded on the device, though a ton of others did (Pandora, Bloomberg, Showtime Anytime, Netflix, Vevo, Vimeo, WatchESPN, Crackle, HuluPlus, iheartradio, and tuneinradio).IF you have an Amazon Kindle TABLET (I'm guessing like the HDX), you can somehow toss photos from the tablet directly to the Fire. Meaning, sitting in your living room, you can, apparently, swipe the photo across the screen and it lands on the Fire. (Don't have that, so can't DO that). HOWEVER, we do have many photos saved to Amazon's Cloud Drive they were all accessible from the FireTV console (via the TV, with just a click)--even a short family video we'd uploaded. With no interference from me. Just clicked on Photos there they were. EASY.

"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 7 Fire tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is fully half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case.

"This is a great case! It allows access to all ports and camera, while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself.

"This works as a case, and matches the color of the kindle nicely. The main feature I wanted was the stand, however. It is only one corner flap, as pictured.

Starting out, my kindle would sit at a nice 70 degree or so angle from the table, but now my kindle will sit at maybe 30 degrees off the table. Eventually it will just go flat.

"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light.

"I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have.

"I've had this a week now. I also have a Kindle Fire HD I have had for about a year, with the case on, the Fire HD is heavy. I love the HD, and never leave home with out it, but many times I wish I could just slip my books in my pocket and run. I go a lot of places on the run, take others places where I wait for them to shop or what ever, and there is not WiFi to play on my Fire HD. I just want to read. My reading time has come up from one book a year to 50 books a year, and now my reading will go up even more.This was the perfect answer. So feather light It is incredible. It is taking me a bit to not swipe the screen to turn a page, and get used to the lay out and use of the various buttons, but after an hour I had read the built in owners manual, learned the ins and outs of the buttons and had it set up. It connected to my WiFi instantly. The on screen key board has taken a bit to get used to but once you use it a few times you can do it pretty fast.I wondered how all my content, library of books would be transferred from my Fire HD, to this device. To my pleasant surprise after connecting to my Wi-Fi, the next time I looked at the home menu my entire library of over 300 books was there, archived. I just click a title and it down loads in seconds.I honestly can't tell the difference between the print on this and the print on my Fire HD. Pixel wise, my eyes can't differentiate a thing.I love the texture look of a page from a book look. The no glare is amazing. There are times and places I can't read or see the screen on my Fire HD, and this just runs circles around the reading in bright light.

"This is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 Kindle Fire. Inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your Kindle into. The frame solidly holds your Kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. The case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.The exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. It is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. The one in my video is marine blue. The top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.The cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. I like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. The inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.I like that the micro SD card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. That helps to protect the SD card from being lost or quickly stolen. A large memory size SD card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.The tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. I show this in my product video. All of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. That includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on/off button.The cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the Internet or watching movies.Read more",4.0,B071NMTDHR,1,this is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new inch kindle fire inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your kindle into the frame solidly holds your kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops the case weighs in at ounces the exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish it is available in canary yellow charcoal black cobalt blue marine blue and punch red the one in my video is marine blue the top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened the cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover i like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power the inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed i like that the micro sd card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case that helps to protect the sd card from being lost or quickly stolen a large memory size sd card can cost to almost and the added security is helpful the tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video i show this in my product video all of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case that includes the volume controls the headphone jack the microphone the power charging port and the power on off button the cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading browsing the internet or watching movies read more

"As with other recent Fire covers by Amazon, the cover has a snap-in plastic shell that holds the Fire securely and will not let it fall out. (I've used plastic shells similar to this for years with my Kindles and Kindle Fires, and none of them has ever slipped out.)Another feature that I look for is Auto Wake/Sleep, which automatically wakes the tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when the cover is closed. It's a very useful feature that helps to extend battery life, since you don't have to remember to hit the power switch when you close the cover. It's also a huge convenience feature.Other comments:* All of the Fire's ports and controls are on top of the Fire, which is open on the case. The speakers are covered, but when the case is opened, they're uncovered. Note that the cover does block the micro SD card port on the side.* The microfiber inside of the top cover helps prevent scratches to the display screen.* The front cover can be folded to act as a viewing stand. It's a nice feature, especially for watching videos.* With the cover folded back on itself, the rear camera is blocked. To use the camera, you'll have to keep the cover open.

"I've had the new Fire HD 8 with the case for about a week. I use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobooks. So far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed. Why is that There is no reason I can think of why my volume needs should change because I closed the lid. BTW, the marine blue is lovely. The speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre, is noticeably diminished.

"As a Kindle case, this works, but it's got a few too many negatives.To the good, it's nice and thick, meaning it gives good protection, and your Kindle snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my 7 HDX's magnetic case, meaning your Kindle won't fall out if you tip it too far.However.1. I hate the flap this has for propping it up. Maybe I was spoiled by my last Kindle's case, but I had one of the magnetic origami ones, and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the Kindle up on either of the long sides. This one's flap isn't magnetic, and it's just one diagonal fold, which makes gives far less support. The thing tips over or collapses more than I'd like it to, and if I want to read in landscape orientation (i.e. the long sides go left to right rather than up and down), the top and bottom aren't interchangeable. That wouldn't normally be a problem, but...2. There's a camera on the back of the Kindle 8, and the case has a hole for it. The problem is, there's only one hole, which means there's a right way and a wrong way to put the Kindle into it. Like I said, none of this would normally be a problem, except I sometimes use it while it's charging, and my outlet is on the left side of the bed. Naturally, the stand puts the USB thing on the right side of the Kindle. Assuming I don't want to cover the camera, I can either prop it up while I read, or let it charge while I read, but not both. (I'll probably order a longer USB cable, but the one the Kindle comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side.) I wish they'd punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the Kindle fits.3.

"In this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways, its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this. It covers the Fire fine. The fit is snug and snaps into place no problem. A hidden magnet auto-wakes/sleeps the display when you open/close it. The fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants. Yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of propping up fire when you want to use it hands free. You can get it to stay, but it often slides out, or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle.

"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 8 Fire HD tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with the Amazon leather case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet.

"When I purchased my Kindle Fire HD 8, this was the recommended case at checkout. I purchased it thinking that an Amazon sourced cased should work and fit well. I'm very happy with my choice of this case both with its style/look and function. The price is much lower than that of the case in which I keep my Kindle Paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the Fire.To my match my black Kindle Fire, I chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweed style look in various shades of gray and black. It has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers I have used on my Paperwhite. The inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection. It does not have an internal pocket. My Kindle Fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case.The case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place. Whether the case is open or closed, the ports for charging, the MicroSD port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed. When it is closed, the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens. When the cover is fully open and folded to the back, the rear camera lens is covered (the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open.) If you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case, you can hold the front cover in your off-hand while it is in use.As I have a tendency to leave my Paperwhite on (and run down the battery fairly regularly), I appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it.",5.0,B071NMTDHR,1,when i purchased my kindle fire hd this was the recommended case at checkout i purchased it thinking that an amazon sourced cased should work and fit well i m very happy with my choice of this case both with its style look and function the price is much lower than that of the case in which i keep my kindle paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the fire to my match my black kindle fire i chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweed style look in various shades of gray and black it has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers i have used on my paperwhite the inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection it does not have an internal pocket my kindle fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case the case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place whether the case is open or closed the ports for charging the microsd port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed when it is closed the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens when the cover is fully open and folded to the back the rear camera lens is covered the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open if you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case you can hold the front cover in your off hand while it is in use as i have a tendency to leave my paperwhite on and run down the battery fairly regularly i appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it
"This is an improvement over the Origami case we purchased for my husband's old 2013 Fire 7. He liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me. This one has only 2 sections, so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation. (Just give the tablet a 180 if you can't get it to stand.) I don't usually like blue, but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly. There is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive. The cutouts are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover. I often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases, but I had no trouble removing this one when I needed to. The only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times.

"The Fire HD 8 seemed like a great deal to me considering the size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offered exactly that...but fell short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, larger screen than the 6 Fire, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a decent device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device. If you're looking for a very basic tablet to watch videos or for your kids, the 49.99 Fire is a better option.QUICK SUMMARY:PROs - Price, dual stereo speakers, expandable memory slot (great for viewing content offline), full access to Amazon content. Good basic tablet specially for watching videos.CONs - Screen resolution crisp but not great, lags quite a bit when switching or starting/closing apps (runs fine once an app is open), battery life is just ok, freezes quite often and the only solution is to reboot the device which becomes frustrating after a while.The device is basically slow to load apps, lags quite a bit when switching apps (this becomes worse as you load more content on the device), freezes quite often, and I find myself having to reboot it every now and then. A frustrating experience to say the least. The device is claimed to be Designed for Entertainment - true, but I would also add Not designed for performance.This is meant to be a basic value tablet giving you access to the Amazon ecosystem, and it is exactly that.Read more",3.0,B0117U82EM,0,the fire hd seemed like a great deal to me considering the size economical price point and the ability to watch content offline and it offered exactly that but fell short on performance parameters if you re price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet larger screen than the fire and the ability to watch content offline this is a decent device to get however if you already have an earlier kindle like the hdx or even an earlier version of the fire i recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn t really be a worthwhile upgrade i have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device if you re looking for a very basic tablet to watch videos or for your kids the fire is a better option quick summary pros price dual stereo speakers expandable memory slot great for viewing content offline full access to amazon content good basic tablet specially for watching videos cons screen resolution crisp but not great lags quite a bit when switching or starting closing apps runs fine once an app is open battery life is just ok freezes quite often and the only solution is to reboot the device which becomes frustrating after a while the device is basically slow to load apps lags quite a bit when switching apps this becomes worse as you load more content on the device freezes quite often and i find myself having to reboot it every now and then a frustrating experience to say the least the device is claimed to be designed for entertainment true but i would also add not designed for performance this is meant to be a basic value tablet giving you access to the amazon ecosystem and it is exactly that read more
"Let me make things simple for everyone. This is a great tablet and a beautiful device. It has everything 97 of tablet users need and want. The 3 that are power users can pay up for an iPad.Amazon Prime is a must if you have one of these tablets. And if you already have Amazon Prime it is a no-brainer to buy this tablet if you are looking for an entertainment device that also gives you the ability to check email and surf the web as needed.People complain that one app here or there is missing. If you want the tried and true, the basics, then you have nothing to worry about. Of course there is a weather app. Of course there is a NYT app. All the 'normal' stuff is there. Sure, a particular game or more specialized app may not be available but anything most people actually 'want/need' is going to be there.This is not a device for the office. If you want to review spreadsheets then clearly do not buy it. That goes without saying.As for the actual device it feels well put together. The plastic back actually felt closer to metal to me. It has a solid feel. The screen is beautiful and has PLENTY of resolution for watching movies, surfing the web, etc. It is also sufficient for reading, though the Kindle Paperwhite admittedly has clearer print so if you only plan to read on this device then get the Paperwhite. (Also, I find the Word Runner feature to be quite intriguing- in fact I think we all may read using this method in a few years.)Before buying the device I read that load times are slow and switching between apps is trouble. What I have found is that it may take a second for your movie or app to load...but we are talking a second...or two MAX!

"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the Fire HD 8 from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon removed the Fire HD7, the Fire HDX7 and the Fire HDX8.9 and replaced them with the Fire HD (7 screen), Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.HARDWARE:WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: The HD8 Fire, a short USB cord and a power adapter. Finally, Amazon ships a power adapter with their Fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (Picture attached)SIZE: The HD8 is longer than the older HD7 but the same width as the discontinued HD7. It is also thinner. (8.4x5.0x0.3 versus 7.5x5.0x0.4). I have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, I really need to use both hands. Because it is longer, it seem top heavy to me. The back is also slick and slippery to hold. Mine has a habit of sliding off the table.Display: The resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the HD 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. In practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. The display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. One nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper! It comes with 9 stock images and if you don't like one of them, you can choose your own image in your Amazon Photos folder.Read more",3.0,B0117U82EM,0,as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing my first impressions of the fire hd from the perspective of being a long time kindle user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindle the paperwhite models the fire hd fire hd fire hdx and fire hdx rd and th generation here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new fire hd amazon removed the fire hd the fire hdx and the fire hdx and replaced them with the fire hd screen fire hd and fire hd hardware what comes in the box the hd fire a short usb cord and a power adapter finally amazon ships a power adapter with their fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box picture attached size the hd is longer than the older hd but the same width as the discontinued hd it is also thinner x x versus x x i have large hands and can hold it with one hand but even with my hands i really need to use both hands because it is longer it seem top heavy to me the back is also slick and slippery to hold mine has a habit of sliding off the table display the resolution of the screen is x same as the hd but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length in practical use though you can t tell the difference the display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight one nice touch is that now you can choose your own wallpaper it comes with stock images and if you don t like one of them you can choose your own image in your amazon photos folder read more

"I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. But, keep in mind that this is not an iPad or typical Android tablet. This is an Amazon media and shopping machine. It is well built, has good battery life, reasonably fast and responsive, dual band wifi, SD card slot, decent display and so-so camera. No tablet is going to give you awesome sound, but I was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet. No tablet it going to give you a great camera, and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum - it works, but it won't be your go-to camera for important shots. This tablet excels at playing Amazon content - music and video. It is a great reader, although a little heavy compared to a Kindle device. It makes shopping easy - perhaps too easy. The OS is based on Android, but don't look for Google Play or Google apps in general - this is nothing like an Android tablet. Finally, you can't beat the price. I think Amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible. I would have given this 4.5 stars if that option was available. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet. This is a dramatic improvement over the Fire 7.

"All right so I was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars. One such was that the tablet weighed a whole 3 oz more and that resulted in a 3 star review. Let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous. It says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing. The other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen. That's why you get a cheap and good tablet. It even says in the discription that there will be ads on the lock screen. It takes a second to swipe up and unlock the screen. So the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit-pick.This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review.Buy this tablet if you want a cheap e-reader that can also sure the web, watch movies and shows, check Facebook or Twitter, or read books on. Ignore the negative reviews and you won't be disappointed.",5.0,B01M3ULMWP,1,all right so i was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars one such was that the tablet weighed a whole oz more and that resulted in a star review let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous it says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing the other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen that s why you get a cheap and good tablet it even says in the discription that there will be ads on the lock screen it takes a second to swipe up and unlock the screen so the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit pick this tablet is exactly what amazon was describing it is cheap looks good loads apps quickly expandable storage good speakers decent screen and all while staying under bucks the start up didn t take long and it came preloaded with my account on it for dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review buy this tablet if you want a cheap e reader that can also sure the web watch movies and shows check facebook or twitter or read books on ignore the negative reviews and you won t be disappointed
"First, let me say that this is my first Fire tablet. I've previously had either iPad's or Android tablets. I was skeptical at first because I've generally only liked iPad's, but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I paid full price for this product and am not being compensated in any manner to post this review.Let's just jump right to the Pro's and Con's shall wePro's:FastAmazing Screen resolutionGreat soundResponsiveAlexa is kind of awesomeBattery life. OMG! I've charged it once so far, I've watched YouTube videos on it, streamed a movie and a few TV shows and I use it for Facebook and I'm not even half way down on the battery after 3 days. Wow!The OS. The operating system is simple, responsive, and beautifully done. Everything is easy to find and it's really easy to navigate.Con's:Only one Con...Charge port. The charge port is sticky and doesn't seem as high quality.Overall this is a fantastic tablet and worth so much more than the price.

"So happy with my new fire and I wish I had bought more! Some of the PROS of this tablet are it has Alexa, Memory expansion slot, and a nice size. At 8 inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and Ebook . It is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids. The apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen. I install the Google Play store and Connect to the google play store to download apps is easy, like youtube. Without the Google Play store you will stuck with the Amazon store and apps.I often use the tablet to watch videos with my meidong E6 bluetooth headphones Meidong E6ANC Bluetooth Headphones Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Wireless Stereo headphones with Microphone, Ergonomic Design for Kids Adult-Black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for, this is right for you. And it has two colors for choice, black and rosegold,I have bought two. I did some research and found that the meidong company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth/ANC headphones, vibration speakers,wifi speakers. No wonder their headphones sound really nice, also recommend.Back to here,The only 1 CONS I would say about that The tablet has two camera, rear is 2mp and front is 0.3mp, very very basic. Having two speakers but the speaker is not great.Overall, it is a good value for the price,This tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do.",5.0,B01M3ULMWP,1,so happy with my new fire and i wish i had bought more some of the pros of this tablet are it has alexa memory expansion slot and a nice size at inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and ebook it is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids the apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen i install the google play store and connect to the google play store to download apps is easy like youtube without the google play store you will stuck with the amazon store and apps i often use the tablet to watch videos with my meidong e bluetooth headphones meidong e anc bluetooth headphones active noise cancelling headphones wireless stereo headphones with microphone ergonomic design for kids adult black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for this is right for you and it has two colors for choice black and rosegold i have bought two i did some research and found that the meidong company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth anc headphones vibration speakers wifi speakers no wonder their headphones sound really nice also recommend back to here the only cons i would say about that the tablet has two camera rear is mp and front is mp very very basic having two speakers but the speaker is not great overall it is a good value for the price this tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do
"Let me start by saying I purchased this item from my local Best Buy store for the same price here on Amazon (plus tax) but I feel that more people read Amazon reviews so I wanted to leave my review here. Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my 900 smartphone, 1000 laptop and 500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem.Read more",4.0,B01M3ULMWP,1,let me start by saying i purchased this item from my local best buy store for the same price here on amazon plus tax but i feel that more people read amazon reviews so i wanted to leave my review here now i didn t expect this to be an amazing tablet but people were generally saying it was snappy enough i wanted a media tablet something i could use late at night to watch youtube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed i also like it for online shopping so i don t have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen pros tablet exceeded my expectations it s great for media i use this more than my phone and my laptop now it s snappy i was able to complete my homework for online classes watch videos from cnn and other tasks without too much struggleit can be a general purpose tablet heed my warning doing the following may void your warranty with amazon i m not sure but i installed the google play store on my fire hd and now have access to a huge selection of apps i decided to do this after finding there was no good youtube app from amazon s app store because fire os is basically android with a heavy skin on it everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures sound is fantastic did i say that loud enough yes they are still tablet speakers no they won t fill your whole room with bumping bass but my gosh these are some good tablet speakers better than my smartphone laptop and ipad what i m trying to say is the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest bravo amazon cons ram is lacking doesn t excel in multitasking drops tasks while you re away even if it was the last thing you were doing it does this randomly however and it s not always a problem read more
"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function.

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me.

"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function.

"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more",5.0,B00LWHU9D8,1,for the low price this tablet really does more than expected the camera isn t great however i always use my phone for a camera so that doesn t effect me here are some of the pros and cons pros low cost yet high tech great screen quality of course there is better out there but it looks great as is smooth and responsive easy access to amazon prime content easy to wirelessly share content to a tv battery life web browser works greatcons doesn t have some apps android users are used to having camera quality isn t great and no flash less extra features than some higher priced tablets havei opted to go with the gb version with no ads the ads aren t a big deal but i figured i would pass on having them on my screen no matter what version you pick they all do the same things the gigs may or may not matter to you and gigs both aren t very large but if you want to predownload some tv shows movies music before a vacation then you may want to look into getting the larger gig if you will always have internet connection then it isn t much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet overall if you want an amazon tablet and you want the best go with the hdx series however if you want an amazing tablet but don t want to spend as much then these new hd series are great for me and my uses the hd is the perfect fit i would suggest the over the for most buyers the only things the has over the are a larger screen and dual speakers sure the dual speakers is kind of nice but the screen is actually lower quality than the read more

"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.Read more",5.0,B00LWHU9D8,1,i ll preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting a tablet to perform at anywhere near that level i have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured i d give the kindle fire hd a try i chose the base gb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access what i ve found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews in fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the year s best purchase first off the look is nice it s sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than i d imagined it s not heavy enough to be considered a negative the display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate response to the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasantly surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit for those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide you i first checked out the e reader function my books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the reader read more

"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a 99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level.

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones.

"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded.

This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use.

"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the NEW Fire HD 8 released on September 21, 2016 from the perspective of being a long-term Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation), the old Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10. Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon has replaced the original HD 8 released in 2015 with an All-New HD 8. Amazon is also removing the Fire HD6, which is a shame as it is a great little tablet.The new HD 8 differs from the old version as follows:BEST NEW FEATURE:The price has been reduced! The 16 GB version of the old device cost 169.99 with special offers (ads). The new 16 GB version costs 89.99 and you can get a 32 HB version for 30 more.SECRETLY REMOVED:Amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on Miracast devices such as TVs. Now that feature is now only available on generation 4 and 5 Fires including last years HD 8. However, you can still cast Prime videos to a FireTV or Fire Stick.WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:The HD8 Fire, a short 3-foot USB cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box.SIZE:The new HD8 is a fraction thicker than the 2015 HD8. Leather cases for the old HD 8 will fit the new HD 8 but hard shell cases will not. However the auto wake feature of some older cases won't work.One complaint I had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case.Read more",5.0,B01BRWH8G8,1,as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing my first impressions of the new fire hd released on september from the perspective of being a long term kindle user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindle the paperwhite models the fire hd fire hd fire hdx and fire hdx rd and th generation the old fire hd and the fire hd here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new fire hd amazon has replaced the original hd released in with an all new hd amazon is also removing the fire hd which is a shame as it is a great little tablet the new hd differs from the old version as follows best new feature the price has been reduced the gb version of the old device cost with special offers ads the new gb version costs and you can get a hb version for more secretly removed amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on miracast devices such as tvs now that feature is now only available on generation and fires including last years hd however you can still cast prime videos to a firetv or fire stick what comes in the box the hd fire a short foot usb cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box size the new hd is a fraction thicker than the hd leather cases for the old hd will fit the new hd but hard shell cases will not however the auto wake feature of some older cases won t work one complaint i had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case read more
"I am thrilled with the new Fire HD8 - even before it gets Alexa! At that time I will likely be ecstatic! I am far from a tablet novice - I had the original fire the 50 fire the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and the Galaxy Tab S 10.5. My phones have always been Samsung flagship phones, currently the S7 Edge. I say this to show that I 1) have experience with kindle fires, and 2) generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices -- I KNOW what is a good tablet and what is a so-so tablet. Admittedly, my previous fires have been so-so, but I wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my Galaxy Tab S 10.5.My HD8 is the 32gb option, with offers. Most users will likely be fine with 16gb and perhaps an added 32gb or 64gb SD card. However, I know how I use my devices, so went with the 32gb option, as well as a 64gb micro SD card. In the 48 hours I have had my new Fire, it has become my device of choice, even over my 500 samsung (more convenient size). I use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new Fire replaces my two 7 inch tablets as the go to device.Before receiving it, I wasn't sure about the low resolution (1280 x 800) on this tab, but honestly, it's not a problem! Sure, it's not bright and beautiful like my Tab S ... but its crisp, clean, and clear. The colors are sufficient, but not vibrant, sadly. (The comparison photo below is the HD8 (2016) and Fire 7 (2015).Sound is quite good, with good volume. The speakers are on the left side when portrait, on top (or bottom) in landscape. I prefer them on top. The sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use earphones, unless in a noisy environment, in which case you would likely want to use earphones anyway.Read more",5.0,B01BRWH8G8,1,i am thrilled with the new fire hd even before it gets alexa at that time i will likely be ecstatic i am far from a tablet novice i had the original fire the fire the samsung galaxy tab and the galaxy tab s my phones have always been samsung flagship phones currently the s edge i say this to show that i have experience with kindle fires and generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices i know what is a good tablet and what is a so so tablet admittedly my previous fires have been so so but i wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my galaxy tab s my hd is the gb option with offers most users will likely be fine with gb and perhaps an added gb or gb sd card however i know how i use my devices so went with the gb option as well as a gb micro sd card in the hours i have had my new fire it has become my device of choice even over my samsung more convenient size i use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new fire replaces my two inch tablets as the go to device before receiving it i wasn t sure about the low resolution x on this tab but honestly it s not a problem sure it s not bright and beautiful like my tab s but its crisp clean and clear the colors are sufficient but not vibrant sadly the comparison photo below is the hd and fire sound is quite good with good volume the speakers are on the left side when portrait on top or bottom in landscape i prefer them on top the sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use earphones unless in a noisy environment in which case you would likely want to use earphones anyway read more
"First off,i appreciate you reading this review :) Just so you get a little background on me, we are major tech users. We have multiple tablets from apple,samsung,and asus. This fire tablet is comparable in a different way. This tablet uses a amazon based operating system, Fire os. So no play store or itunes... As a prime member however, this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benifits. Ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past 2 days. I ordered 2 of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use. We have Gone thru 3 full power cycles (fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use) it does get 10-11 hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus! This tablet is a keeper. Screen looks fantastic. Colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resoloution for everyday use is perfect for this price point. Speed is snappy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue. On a passmark benchmark test i got a score of 3377. However the second HD 8 constantly grades about 30-35 points lower. So it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet,they might be built slightly different so performance will vary. At this price point I didnt expect them to come out exactly the same. This tablet is bassically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price! Oh and the hd 8 actually offers a slightly better resoloution then the samsung! Minus one star for the wifi connection. I have lost connection several times on both tablets. Seems to only happen on my 5g connection.Also the screen being so reflective,it is impossible to use at all outdoors.also sadly is a fingerprint magnet.Read more",4.0,B01BRWH8G8,1,first off i appreciate you reading this review just so you get a little background on me we are major tech users we have multiple tablets from apple samsung and asus this fire tablet is comparable in a different way this tablet uses a amazon based operating system fire os so no play store or itunes as a prime member however this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benifits ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past days i ordered of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use we have gone thru full power cycles fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use it does get hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus this tablet is a keeper screen looks fantastic colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resoloution for everyday use is perfect for this price point speed is snappy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue on a passmark benchmark test i got a score of however the second hd constantly grades about points lower so it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet they might be built slightly different so performance will vary at this price point i didnt expect them to come out exactly the same this tablet is bassically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price oh and the hd actually offers a slightly better resoloution then the samsung minus one star for the wifi connection i have lost connection several times on both tablets seems to only happen on my g connection also the screen being so reflective it is impossible to use at all outdoors also sadly is a fingerprint magnet read more
"We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface.",5.0,B01M4NRFXX,1,we got this the day it came out i have a four year old daughter and she loves it we have an ipad for her but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them this tablet restricts all in app purchasing yay we tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well but so far this one works well i have two requests to amazon and i am hoping that someone from amazon reads my review so they can make this change please change amazon freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections there are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section so then when i restrict her tablet to books only she can t access them i would love it so much if you they would fix this a few examples of the stories she can t access when i restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following nighty night charlie brown s the berenstain bears and dino store story the other recommendation i have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted as it is now she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them i really like this product and i think it so great for children it just needs a few little improvements to the freetime interface
"I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who do not know what they are doing, or don't fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential. This tablet DOES allow you download any app that you would find on the play store! Because of the parental features you have to first download them on YOUR PARENT PROFILE FIRST!! I love that about this tablet. Also, I can block the camera AND web browser so my child can't access that either! I can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles, WiFi access, settings, etc. It's really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so I had plenty of time download what I wanted for my daughter and set it all up before I had to put it on the charger... It does, however, take a bit long to complete charge to 100, but no big deal. This is a great tablet so far and we are thoroughly enjoying it :)",5.0,B01M4NRFXX,1,i feel like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who do not know what they are doing or don t fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential this tablet does allow you download any app that you would find on the play store because of the parental features you have to first download them on your parent profile first i love that about this tablet also i can block the camera and web browser so my child can t access that either i can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles wifi access settings etc it s really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so i had plenty of time download what i wanted for my daughter and set it all up before i had to put it on the charger it does however take a bit long to complete charge to but no big deal this is a great tablet so far and we are thoroughly enjoying it
"June 18 is not only the Father's Day but also my older daughter's birthday. She turns 6 years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her. Her younger sister has Fire 7, so it was logical for us to buy Fire 8 for her, as she's older.We bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose, than to watch cartoons. My husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code. There are so many different apps for that.We have already tested it today, when the tablet arrived, but haven't shown it to our daughter yet.There are three different colors and we chose the blue one, as it's her favorite color. It's very bright, the case looks like removable foam shell, very sturdy and easy to grab. It's actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device, it's better to go neutral.There is a possibility to expand storage up to 256 Gb, but I think 32 Gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter.Big cutouts make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons, as well as the charging port and headphone jack.The display is ok for the price. When I watched Peppa Pig, images looked sharp and colors were vibrant, even at extreme angles. The sound is much better here than in Fire 7 Kids Edition, and that's due to dual stereo speakers.I don't know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter, but for us it was great, nothing odd or unnecessary. My favorite option is Parent Control. I can password-protect purchases (including in-app purchases), Wi-Fi access and more.Read more",5.0,B01M4NRFXX,1,june is not only the father s day but also my older daughter s birthday she turns years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her her younger sister has fire so it was logical for us to buy fire for her as she s older we bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose than to watch cartoons my husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code there are so many different apps for that we have already tested it today when the tablet arrived but haven t shown it to our daughter yet there are three different colors and we chose the blue one as it s her favorite color it s very bright the case looks like removable foam shell very sturdy and easy to grab it s actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device it s better to go neutral there is a possibility to expand storage up to gb but i think gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter big cutouts make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons as well as the charging port and headphone jack the display is ok for the price when i watched peppa pig images looked sharp and colors were vibrant even at extreme angles the sound is much better here than in fire kids edition and that s due to dual stereo speakers i don t know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter but for us it was great nothing odd or unnecessary my favorite option is parent control i can password protect purchases including in app purchases wi fi access and more read more
"The Fire HD 8 kids tablet is essentially an HD 8 with the kids cover, FreeTime, and a 2 year warranty. Lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi, higher quality 720p screen, Dolby stereo speakers, double the storage, and increased battery life.The kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops. The IPS screen has excellent viewing angles, vibrant colors, and offers plenty of brightness indoors. However once you move outside the screen will wash out if you're in the sun. The dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume. It's a shame that the cameras don't offer higher resolution, but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren't that steady. Should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a 256GB microSD card.FreeTime has a wealth of content, and it includes a kid-safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or Amazon. If you don't want your child using the browser then it can be turned off. You can also restrict access to certain categories, set time limits, and view what your children are watching and reading with the Parent Dashboard. After the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service.Tips:- You can view Amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi. Switch to your adult profile and download the video(s). Now go into settings, profiles and family library, select your child profile, add content, videos, and select your videos.- You can sideload Google Play and gain access to even more apps such as YouTube Kids.- You can set FreeTime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met.",5.0,B01M4NRFXX,1,the fire hd kids tablet is essentially an hd with the kids cover freetime and a year warranty lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi higher quality p screen dolby stereo speakers double the storage and increased battery life the kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops the ips screen has excellent viewing angles vibrant colors and offers plenty of brightness indoors however once you move outside the screen will wash out if you re in the sun the dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume it s a shame that the cameras don t offer higher resolution but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren t that steady should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a gb microsd card freetime has a wealth of content and it includes a kid safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or amazon if you don t want your child using the browser then it can be turned off you can also restrict access to certain categories set time limits and view what your children are watching and reading with the parent dashboard after the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service tips you can view amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi switch to your adult profile and download the video s now go into settings profiles and family library select your child profile add content videos and select your videos you can sideload google play and gain access to even more apps such as youtube kids you can set freetime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met
"I bought 2 of these for christmas presents and I have to say they aren't very kid friendly. Every kindle I've had in the past has been pretty easy to use, this one has a lot of options that I think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate. They have an easier time using the other devices (kindle fire, or kindle app on their other tablets) which is unfortunate because I wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading. Also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children's books don't work with this device. No where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an 8th generation kindle. Now, I have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out, but I haven't followed close enough to know this is an 8th generation without that information available on the page. I planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e-readers 5th generation. I assumed since it was the latest one listed, and my new devices didn't have anything listed, it was the latest. I just found out today that its an 8th generation and a lot of books aren't available on this device, with hopes that will change in the future. So now I have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices (the devices with games and access to the internet and videos). I spent extra money on 2 new devices so they had something to use daily without that access, all to find out their age appropriate books can't be read on their new devices. I think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them. Reading is important to children of all ages, and they can only read at their own levels.Read more",3.0,B01KVZDFD2,0,i bought of these for christmas presents and i have to say they aren t very kid friendly every kindle i ve had in the past has been pretty easy to use this one has a lot of options that i think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate they have an easier time using the other devices kindle fire or kindle app on their other tablets which is unfortunate because i wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children s books don t work with this device no where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an th generation kindle now i have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out but i haven t followed close enough to know this is an th generation without that information available on the page i planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e readers th generation i assumed since it was the latest one listed and my new devices didn t have anything listed it was the latest i just found out today that its an th generation and a lot of books aren t available on this device with hopes that will change in the future so now i have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices the devices with games and access to the internet and videos i spent extra money on new devices so they had something to use daily without that access all to find out their age appropriate books can t be read on their new devices i think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them reading is important to children of all ages and they can only read at their own levels read more

"I loved the concept of an ereader that would not be screen time. However, I have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior kindles I have owned. First, this product has no speaker of any kind, so it cannot play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones. A big loss - no current Kindle ereader can play audible books -- only older generation kindle ereaders or the Fire (which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time) - and sometimes, my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along. Second, it operates SLOWLY. Third, the Freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there. The categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore - e.g. mystery, biography, early chapter books, realistic fiction, series, etc - but an odd collection of categories - e.g. ballet, Frozen, Disney, Trucks, etc. Most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books I would want her to read. And there is no description of the book (like the blurb on the Amazon website) - so there is no way other than the title (and the unhelpful category) to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it. Finally, when I called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within Free time, and to put books from my Amazon account in the freetime library, I got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions (presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up) and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent.Read more",3.0,B01KVZDFD2,0,i loved the concept of an ereader that would not be screen time however i have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior kindles i have owned first this product has no speaker of any kind so it cannot play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones a big loss no current kindle ereader can play audible books only older generation kindle ereaders or the fire which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time and sometimes my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along second it operates slowly third the freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there the categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore e g mystery biography early chapter books realistic fiction series etc but an odd collection of categories e g ballet frozen disney trucks etc most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books i would want her to read and there is no description of the book like the blurb on the amazon website so there is no way other than the title and the unhelpful category to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it finally when i called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within free time and to put books from my amazon account in the freetime library i got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent read more
"This is quite the steal! As already pointed out, the total value is 144.97. At the 99.99 price, this is a great deal. I was able to use the recent Prime 30 off offer to get this for 69.99. I bought this to have a Kindle to keep in my bag. My regular Kindle is the Voyage, but I've owned several other Kindles (K3 to Oasis).

"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded.

"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",5.0,B01LW1MS9C,1,i am thoroughly impressed with my echo dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop the construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the echo this case cover will give your echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in but still offer the great functionality of alexa

"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen.

"Having a tablet or a phone is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we can do about it. And I know, there are toddlers over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around. But that's not our case. Our daughter is three years old, and she's a very nice girl, but she hates grocery shopping, she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps, are her favorite cartoons.Earlier we gave her my or my husband's phone, but it's so easy for a toddler to drop things down, so we made a decision to buy her a tablet. The price was a trigger for us to buy Fire HD Kids Edition.We did not have the previous edition, but as far as I know, the only difference between them are that the 7th gen Fire 7 has a dual-band WiFi antenna and a slightly newer GPU.At first, we considered buying a 50 Fire 7 (regular one), but there are so many benefits in the kid's edition, that it's definitely worth to pay an extra 50 for it. And those benefits, that were important for us, are: - Kid-Proof Case. That's a must have! I chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it. - 2-year worry-free guarantee. - One year of FreeTime Unlimited. She will love all the apps and game that are free. - I can choose what content my daughter will watch.The battery life is great, my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day, so it should work on a single charge for a week, or so.The display quality is just ok, I expected it to be at least better than the previous version (my nephew has it), but it's just the same.During the first day it has been dropped, and thrown, and kicked and it survived.Read more",5.0,B01M4NU4OM,1,having a tablet or a phone is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we can do about it and i know there are toddlers over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around but that s not our case our daughter is three years old and she s a very nice girl but she hates grocery shopping she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps are her favorite cartoons earlier we gave her my or my husband s phone but it s so easy for a toddler to drop things down so we made a decision to buy her a tablet the price was a trigger for us to buy fire hd kids edition we did not have the previous edition but as far as i know the only difference between them are that the th gen fire has a dual band wifi antenna and a slightly newer gpu at first we considered buying a fire regular one but there are so many benefits in the kid s edition that it s definitely worth to pay an extra for it and those benefits that were important for us are kid proof case that s a must have i chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it year worry free guarantee one year of freetime unlimited she will love all the apps and game that are free i can choose what content my daughter will watch the battery life is great my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day so it should work on a single charge for a week or so the display quality is just ok i expected it to be at least better than the previous version my nephew has it but it s just the same during the first day it has been dropped and thrown and kicked and it survived read more
"We have always used Samsung tablets and so this took a little while adjusting how to navigate.So, far we have been using this for about a week and it does take some time to set-up. You will need to go through and make sure all the settings are correct for your kid, and this will take some time (I think the effort is worth it)This review is specifically for the Kids Edition tablet:The tablet:The tablet itself, is a good size for my (almost) 3 yr old. It is not heavy and seems to be the right size for him to handle. The protective case has definitely done its job because we have already had a couple of incidents. (update: this has been thrown against a wall and landed on tile, and no cracks or breaks) The viewing quality is decent. Otherwise, it is what you would expect from a tablet. I have not had another Fire before, so I can only compare this to a Samsung Galaxy, and so far, it is what I would expect from a tablet of this class.The features (the real reason for the purchase):is it worth it YES. DEFINITELYPreviously, we had been sharing our tablet and our phones with our little one, but more and more he would get into content he should not be getting into - everything from buying stuff and watching content not appropriate for his age - ie our downloads of Deadpool and Logan because these look like 'superheroes' but they are not the appropriate ones for kids - (side note: I loved how they portrayed Deadpool and Logan - we are big comic fans and they finally got their characters right!).I have even deleted YouTube from our tablets and hidden the app in our phones in files so that he can't get at them...But this tablet has been a game changer.

"Great toyreal tablet. It is basically a real Fire 7 tablet, with kid's built-in entertainment center. There are 2 modes here: Parent (admin) and Kids (one or multiple accounts). When in Parent mode (password protected), the Fire 7 looks and feels just like an Android tablet with all of the Fire 7 functionality (Facebook, Netflix, Books, blah, blah), so all of us Android users feel right at home. In the Parent mode you can also manage kids accounts: how much they can use the tablet per day, what they can and cannot watch/play, manage their installed apps, ect. When in kid's mode, the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures, easy-to-use, colorful interface. You need to click switch user to switch from Parent to Kids accounts.Some confusion here I got from reading other reviews- the kids apps are not pre-installed the main interface is an app store, just like Google Play, ect. The apps here are unique to this Kids Account, and are all free with the included subscription which includes don't know how many games, Amazon Videos, reading and audio books. You still have to download each app before using it, so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip.",5.0,B01M4NU4OM,1,great toyreal tablet it is basically a real fire tablet with kid s built in entertainment center there are modes here parent admin and kids one or multiple accounts when in parent mode password protected the fire looks and feels just like an android tablet with all of the fire functionality facebook netflix books blah blah so all of us android users feel right at home in the parent mode you can also manage kids accounts how much they can use the tablet per day what they can and cannot watch play manage their installed apps ect when in kid s mode the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures easy to use colorful interface you need to click switch user to switch from parent to kids accounts some confusion here i got from reading other reviews the kids apps are not pre installed the main interface is an app store just like google play ect the apps here are unique to this kids account and are all free with the included subscription which includes don t know how many games amazon videos reading and audio books you still have to download each app before using it so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip
"Really awesome tablet for my 5 year olds, and worth the money. Easy to figure out (for the most part), tons of apps, books and videos. My only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime. There is a carousel on the home page, but only shows the recently used apps. My children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner. I didn't want them to be able to download everything they see, which is easy to do with just a tap. The only solution I found was to block every app except those that are downloaded. You would think there would be an option separate them, given that this is made for a child, but I guess not",4.0,B01M4NU4OM,1,really awesome tablet for my year olds and worth the money easy to figure out for the most part tons of apps books and videos my only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime there is a carousel on the home page but only shows the recently used apps my children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner i didn t want them to be able to download everything they see which is easy to do with just a tap the only solution i found was to block every app except those that are downloaded you would think there would be an option separate them given that this is made for a child but i guess not
"Excellent, my daughter loves this. She can read books, do her school work, watch a few shows, and listen to music. She really enjoys having something that is just for her to use. She is 12 and this was the perfect age appropriate gift that is also extremely functional. I do use the parent settings for some extra security when she is using it unsupervised but otherwise, I do not have a set time limit.

"I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not 500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the 200 price tag. I might pay the 15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me.Read more",4.0,"B008GGCAVM,B00DOPNMVM",1,i ve been an ipad user since the original came out i also have an ipad i have worked in it for the past few years so i would say i am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices with that introduction out of the way i will be reviewing key points that i have seen touched upon in other reviews here goes buildthe device feels nice and solid i m a little surprised at how heavy it is but that s not necessarily a bad thing the rubberized backing is always nice for added grip it s not as nice as say unibody aluminum but it s not either screenthe screen is fantastic but my problem is the same as when ipad got retina display other than the os most apps look rather pixelated a lot of the games i tried are not high definition at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions lock screen adsyeah there are ads on my lock screen i m not sure why this is such a big deal how much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen the first thing i thought when i saw the ads is wow the pictures are really crisp the ads are there to subsidize some of the price tag i might pay the to get rid of them so i can customize it but i might not i feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers soundthe sound from the speakers is great much better than you would get from more expensive devices very crisp and clean i have the official amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all nothing much else to say i doubt anyone will complain about this crashingi ve had two apps crash on opening i don t know if it is the app or the os it s probably somewhere in the middle again not a big deal for me read more

We wanted to answer your question about storage. HD content is much larger than SD content, which is why Kindle Fire HD starts at 16GB. On average, a 90 minute HD movie is 2GB and a 45 minute HD TV episode is 0.9GB. With your 16GB Kindle Fire HD, you can have up to 6 HD movies or 13 HD TV episodes.

"Love it! I purchased this as I have had audible for quite some time now and thought it would be easier just to get the Amazon Brand for downloading from KindlePrime, Audible and even the endless books for being a Prime member AND it is!! I have a reader also, thought that was all I would ever need, now wishing I would have just purchased this in the beginning. Being a Prime Member and all of the new neat things Amazon is coming up with, this is just way better AND easier (for me) NO DOUBT about it. I DO like all the features it has and the tech help available when you have issues (if you are sooo behind in the tech world as I am) -) Next Kindle FIre I purchase will be the 64 GB though...kind of just thought try it on for size (so to speak)... had no idea I would truly like it so much!

"I purchased the Kindle Fire HD after returning a Lenovo Idea Pad. I have also had experience with iPads. Having said that, the Kindle Fire HD is an exceptional value for the money. The screen is FANTASTIC. Glare is kept to a minimum, colors a bright and vibrant, text is clear and easily read, movies look phenomenal in HD. Also, the sound quality and volume is bar-none for a device this size. The touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping, double tapping, and pinch zoom work great. The size, weight and thickness are great for portability. It is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack. The weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip. The amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply, of books, movies, tv shows, music, magazines, and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime. Now, for the negatives. The power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them. I solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons. The Amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store. Hopefully the app library will only grow with the device's popularity. Apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindle. Lastly, the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak. Say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app, when you go back to the home screen, the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see.Read more",4.0,"B008GGCAVM,B00DOPNMVM",1,i purchased the kindle fire hd after returning a lenovo idea pad i have also had experience with ipads having said that the kindle fire hd is an exceptional value for the money the screen is fantastic glare is kept to a minimum colors a bright and vibrant text is clear and easily read movies look phenomenal in hd also the sound quality and volume is bar none for a device this size the touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping double tapping and pinch zoom work great the size weight and thickness are great for portability it is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack the weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip the amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply of books movies tv shows music magazines and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime now for the negatives the power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them i solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons the amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store hopefully the app library will only grow with the device s popularity apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindle lastly the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app when you go back to the home screen the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see read more

"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory.

"Yes..this is my 6th Kindle Fire HD 7 and I am sharing my story so you are not discouraged! My previous Kindle Fire performed well and I decided to upgrade to the newer model with 16GB. My 2nd Kindle Fire arrived as a Christmas gift and the first week I used it, the unit crashed. Ouch! My previous generation-now referred to as Old Faithful -never failed me. I followed the onscreen instructions for Kindle2 and rebooted my device. After using my device for about 30 minutes, it crashed again and the on-screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device. I reset the device and lost all my settings, then again after using the device it crashed. I was not a happy customer so I called Kindle Support.If you are not bored yet...keep reading....Kindle support told me NOT to reset the device, because this erases the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if I reset the device. They advised me to call them when this happens. After a conversation about my new device not working, they agreed to send me another Kindle.Kindle 3, 4 and 5 all arrived...and I returned all of them when I discovered they were refurbished units. Since my device was brand new and I had only used it one week, I expected a brand new device as a replacement. On Kindle 6 I ended up placing a new order (rather than an exchange order) and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me. Problem resolved.It gets worse...Kindle 6 crashed too! Within the first week...again!This time I did not reset the device and instead I would reboot the device. I did this each time I turned on the Kindle.Read more",5.0,"B008GGCAVM,B00DOPNMVM",1,yes this is my th kindle fire hd and i am sharing my story so you are not discouraged my previous kindle fire performed well and i decided to upgrade to the newer model with gb my nd kindle fire arrived as a christmas gift and the first week i used it the unit crashed ouch my previous generation now referred to as old faithful never failed me i followed the onscreen instructions for kindle and rebooted my device after using my device for about minutes it crashed again and the on screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device i reset the device and lost all my settings then again after using the device it crashed i was not a happy customer so i called kindle support if you are not bored yet keep reading kindle support told me not to reset the device because this erases the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if i reset the device they advised me to call them when this happens after a conversation about my new device not working they agreed to send me another kindle kindle and all arrived and i returned all of them when i discovered they were refurbished units since my device was brand new and i had only used it one week i expected a brand new device as a replacement on kindle i ended up placing a new order rather than an exchange order and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me problem resolved it gets worse kindle crashed too within the first week again this time i did not reset the device and instead i would reboot the device i did this each time i turned on the kindle read more

"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle.

"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",4.0,"B008GGCAVM,B00DOPNMVM",1,this new kfhd replaces last year s basic kindle fire although it has some cool new features it lacks a camera microphone and hdmi port for this reason i m glad i kept my model since it does have these features here are my initial impressions of the kindle fire hd i like the placement of the on off volume buttons being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one i never cared for the carousel this is what you see when you turn your kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed and now there s an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead and the apps books can be rearranged to your liking i was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar which is now being called home i don t know why amazon removed this option and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel but you can still bookmark your favorite web pages youtube videos for easy access when i play songs purchased from amazon s mp store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style nice feature but it doesn t work on every song this device has a cool new feature called quick switch which allows us when reading or using an app to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one in terms of sound i find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original kfhd but you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds ironically music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers holding it this way projects the sound out to you read more

"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more",5.0,B00KSR13CE,1,this is the fifth e ink kindle reader that i ve bought my wife and i were early adopters of kindle and when we buy a new kindle the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line i loved the original paperwhite with its small size touch screen front lighting and virtual keyboard the all new paperwhite is a definite step up and for me it was worth the move but others will have to decide for themselves if you read a lot and you don t already have one of the newer e ink kindles it s definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite if you have the original paperwhite the upgrade is well worth considering although i ve only had the new paperwhite a few hours i m already glad i upgraded here s a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite size it s the same size as the original paperwhite x x the weight has been reduced slightly from ounces to ounces the paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand which is how i usually read the really good news is that if you have a case for the original paperwhite it will also fit the new one thank you amazon if you buy a case i highly recommend that the case include the magnetic autowake function it s much easier to turn the kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch lighting the front lighting is noticeably improved over the original paperwhite which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the led lights were located it didn t bother me but some readers were annoyed by that i couldn t see any shadows in the new paperwhite where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform with the paperwhite s front lighting you ll never need a clip on light even in total darkness read more
"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",5.0,B00KSR13CE,1,i have loved and used my kindle keyboard for years now but i missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark i purchased a kindle fire and i also use an ipad but for ease of reading on my eyes i prefer the kindle keyboard i wanted to get a kindle paperwhite e reader but i held off until this new generation was released before i spent my money i got this because i wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and i just love this new tablet it offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text i have added a video of the kindle paperwhite compared to a kindle keyboard and a kindle fire if you have any questions please feel free to contact me and i will try to answer them i love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear i use the kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books reading was my number one hobby my entire life and i just loved it the kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen i can enjoy my reading in every type of environment i laid my kindle keyboard and the new kindle paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new paperwhite the new lighting system and screen clarity is where this paperwhite design really is outstanding with better contrast lighting and custom designed fonts the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e reader before with ppi pixels per inch this screen provides a by pixel screen that just makes the old kindle keyboard look old fashioned technology certainly does move quickly on read more
"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",3.0,B00KSR13CE,0,this review is for the second generation kindle paperwhite like all kindle e readers before it this is a great product however i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year s model for this review i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year s model also i found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising so i will try to clear them up hardwaredesign the kindle white has a nice look and shape it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand it s fairly light so it doesn t tire the hands too much i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite almost identical the height and width are the same the buttons are in the same location and although this version is slightly lighter it is not noticeable display although not a huge improvement from last year s model the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite like most e readers the paperwhite uses digital ink technology this model employs a more advanced version in addition the lighting has been upgraded so among other things it is more evenly lit together they make for incredible viewing in my opinion it s one of the best digital ink e reader display on the market i really enjoy reading on it text look very sharp and crisp with little to no eye strain processor the paperwhite has an upgraded processor which means smoother page turns and navigation i am able to open books flip pages and navigate menus fairly quickly there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time also the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all read more
"Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. Its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and its such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7 model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7 8 or 16 GB 8 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8 model is 10 cheaper--- the 7 model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7 model).Read more",4.0,B01M71HRMY,1,amazon has just updated their bargain priced fire tablets while these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation i believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks and its such a good all around performer for the most part i purchased both the and fire models because i wanted to see how they compared and i was curious how they performed they are both shown in the video attached to this review i will focus here on the model to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive fire tablet is worth the extra money and if the model is worth purchasing on its own merits i ve given this model a star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output see detailed comments below it is still a terrific bargain at the price but i do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses summary these new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation fire tablets same display specs as before amazon says the model has an improved display same processors ghz quad core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation same standard and available storage or gb or gb new colors the model is cheaper the model now has dual band wi fi previously single band wi fi for better connectivity kids edition now available for both models previously only the model read more
"This is my first kindle since the 1st generation. That tablet went away after a couple years. Kindle Fire 7th gen is a great tablet for the money. Honestly, I don't use it for reading. I use it for browsing websites, social media, and listen to podcasts. I use my Bluetooth headphones to listen to the podcasts. The couple times I've used the speaker on the tablet, I haven't been disappointed, but I wasn't impressed. It works just fine for watching videos in bed. Had no problems hearing. Search Google for some tips and tricks to get apps from the google play store. Silk browser is terrible. I reccomend installing Opera.

"Much improved screen!It turns out that the 49.95 Fire 7 version released two years ago didn't have an IPS screen.Now it does.Technically, both the old one and this new one are just 171 ppi (pixels per inch) but this one seems much crisper than the first generation 49-er.My eyes don't lie. IPS makes the screen a lot crisper!There's also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen. Now it holds its own with the 62 color gamut original iPad Mini before, it wasn't anywhere near.Mind you it's not current Apple screen quality, or current high-end Samsung screen quality - but what is It's only 49.95, and it's good enough. Heck, at 49.95, its MORE than good enough, it's great. It blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen, that's for sure.I pulled out my 2015 first-gen, 49.95 Fire 7 - the one this replaces - and placed it side by side with this new one. The colors (including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds) on the old one weren't video-worthy - ok for casual videos on Facebook and YouTube, maybe, but not good enough for Netflixing and Amazon Prime.This new one, though It's movie-worthy, especially with earphones (ok, ONLY with earphones). I'd prefer 720p over the Fire 7's 600p (600p is better than 480p DVD's, but not ask good as even entry-level - 720p - HDTV quality), but overall even at 600p it's eminently watchable.By the way, for me streaming video content on Amazon Prime Instant Video has been noticeably sharper than streaming YouTube. I think Amazon Prime adapts to 600p (max for this tablet) while YouTube is is probably delivering only 480p (remember YouTube's defaults are 360p/480p/720p and up).Read more",5.0,B01M71HRMY,1,much improved screen it turns out that the fire version released two years ago didn t have an ips screen now it does technically both the old one and this new one are just ppi pixels per inch but this one seems much crisper than the first generation er my eyes don t lie ips makes the screen a lot crisper there s also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen now it holds its own with the color gamut original ipad mini before it wasn t anywhere near mind you it s not current apple screen quality or current high end samsung screen quality but what is it s only and it s good enough heck at its more than good enough it s great it blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen that s for sure i pulled out my first gen fire the one this replaces and placed it side by side with this new one the colors including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds on the old one weren t video worthy ok for casual videos on facebook and youtube maybe but not good enough for netflixing and amazon prime this new one though it s movie worthy especially with earphones ok only with earphones i d prefer p over the fire s p p is better than p dvd s but not ask good as even entry level p hdtv quality but overall even at p it s eminently watchable by the way for me streaming video content on amazon prime instant video has been noticeably sharper than streaming youtube i think amazon prime adapts to p max for this tablet while youtube is is probably delivering only p remember youtube s defaults are p p p and up read more

"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without. Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try. Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update: After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1. Use the best speakers you can with it. I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2.

"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant",5.0,B01K8B8YA8,1,so i don t normally write reviews but i just has to this time recently i lost my cat best friend to cancer days after christmas it was the worst day of my life imagine losing your friend that s been with you through every breakup every apartment nearly being homeless and more when he passed i felt such an emptiness in my home a few days ago i was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the amazon echo on the amazon app i remember watching a mr robot episode where some fbi agent who suffers from insomnia was using alexa to keep her entertained so i started researching youtube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it it arrived today and the setup was super easy i immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news then i discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and i completely fell in love with it it s almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down it suggested new music which i actually liked and the built in speaker isn t bad at all for the price the amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now i added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like i would totally recommend buying this product i don t see any negatives other than the fact you can t really ask it followup questions like google assistant but i m sure they ll make it happen thanks for letting me rant

"I am a prime member. This was my first purchase of Echo and I gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it, haha I purchased Echo dot for 2 reasons, 1) I had wanted the original echo but thought the near 200 price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and 2) I wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately I want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is insanely high but she has always been resistant to change. She had no wifi in her bedroom but I resolved that when I purchased TP Link AV500 Wi Fi Range Extender, Powerline Edition which did what no other wifi extender I purchased in past could do, gave my mom's room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines. All I know is that she now has wifi in her room. So I got Echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool. I easily connected Echo to TP-Link and it worked. We asked Alexa a few basic questions, We laughed a little but then I had to leave. When I returned the next day, I walked in and there was music playing (oldies but goodies) and I walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional. I asked her if everything was ok. She was in awe. She was happy. She was emotional because Alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me. The speed that Alexa found the song and played it was mind-boggling. Mom was also planning a dinner in August and needed to know what day of week it was. She would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calender in the kitchen and find the date. But this time she just asked Alexa who gave her the information in like 2 seconds lol.Read more",5.0,B01K8B8YA8,1,i am a prime member this was my first purchase of echo and i gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it haha i purchased echo dot for reasons i had wanted the original echo but thought the near price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and i wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately i want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is insanely high but she has always been resistant to change she had no wifi in her bedroom but i resolved that when i purchased tp link av wi fi range extender powerline edition which did what no other wifi extender i purchased in past could do gave my mom s room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines all i know is that she now has wifi in her room so i got echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool i easily connected echo to tp link and it worked we asked alexa a few basic questions we laughed a little but then i had to leave when i returned the next day i walked in and there was music playing oldies but goodies and i walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional i asked her if everything was ok she was in awe she was happy she was emotional because alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me the speed that alexa found the song and played it was mind boggling mom was also planning a dinner in august and needed to know what day of week it was she would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calender in the kitchen and find the date but this time she just asked alexa who gave her the information in like seconds lol read more
"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen. We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi-room voice recognition technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a multi-device plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices.Read more",5.0,B01K8B8YA8,1,thanks for taking the time to read this review this re release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam although slightly smaller then last years release this device now picks up your voice even better im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better i can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my harmon kardon onyx speaker i found myself yelling at last years echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen we will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi room voice recognition technology amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices so bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note the basic amazon music unlimited will only work on one of your devices not one at a time but one if you want to use it on more than one dot or echo you have to purchase a multi device plan the main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar or you can use the mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating at your own risk of course i have both the amazon tap and the echo unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction hence the bluetooth and the mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices read more

"UPDATED - After spending quite a bit more time with the device, I would give it a 4.5 due to a few specific gaps that are a bit annoying. However, you are still getting an amazing 7 tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a gorgeous interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I cant imagine not buying these for myself and my whole family, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means. For background, I have every Kindle, a couple Fires, and multiple tablets from Apple, Microsoft and Samsung. Note that my review with 5 stars considers the value equation, not just performance and how that may or may not compare to other tablets - if you are expecting this to compare to a tablet costing several times more, don't bother. But if you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value!PRICING/CONFIG: I prefer this tablet with ads and no accessories to keep the costs down. You have the option to spend more money, but I recommend against it. You can easily see the specs online, so I wont do you the discourtesy of simply cutting and pasting those here. Here is the price breakdown: 49.99 base price what an incredible price point! Or buy 5 and get a sixth one free! This puts it into reach of schools and non-profits. No sponsored screensaver (15) big deal that each time you turn it on it shows you something interesting you might want.

"50 Despite the dirt cheap price, i find it to be great for casual use. Videos play nice, games even play nice, text is just not as sexy looking as higher resolution screens. Watch the video for full demo!The short/summed up version: it's the new budget king in the 6-8 size. It's screen is a little lower in resolution but still pleasant to look at, it has enough power for most of the typical tablet tasks, and it shares many of the same features as its higher priced brothers such as front and back cameras, b/g/n wifi, and good overall battery life (minus an hour) My favorite size tablet is 8, so if you're looking at the amazon fire lineup, i would take this over the 6 for sure, and would have a hard time picking the 8 fire at 3x the price. If you're not a prime member, it's still a good tablet, if you are a prime member: it's a great tablet. Possible quality control issue: Mine had two dead pixels (not very noticeable, but still will exchange) You can load APKs(enable unknown sources), i loaded antutu and panasonic image app, both work properly.Just some background, i currently own 5 tablets not including this new one, ranging from a nook color, a samsung tab pro 8.4, LG g pad x8.3, an old acer a500 and an off brand 10.1.

"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it.

First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size.

"I have been using advanced technology for the last 20 years. It was born out of necessity not convenience. My wife passed away 4 years ago leaving me, not only a widow, but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own. We were married 20 years and yes she married me when I was already paralyzed. She was a beautiful lady here on earth and I am sure she is just as beautiful in God's presence. I have to attest that it has been an arduous journey. But one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though I am paralyzed from the chest down, is smart technology. For example, I am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone, computer or tablet. I have lights, electric door locks, electric bed, air-conditioning/heat, cameras, both indoor and out side. Smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when I am laying in bed I cannot use my arms when I am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis. Up to this point, I have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth. They work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long. Smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my 75-year-old mother whose health is, due to God's grace and technology, now stable and she is actually helping me more each day. Alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination. She has given me an opportunity that I never thought would be possible. I still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to Wi-Fi disruption but Alexis is growing more dependable each day. At this point I have only an echo Dot, but I am ordering, when funds allow, the regular echo and another Dot as well.Read more",5.0,B01KIOU214,1,i have been using advanced technology for the last years it was born out of necessity not convenience my wife passed away years ago leaving me not only a widow but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own we were married years and yes she married me when i was already paralyzed she was a beautiful lady here on earth and i am sure she is just as beautiful in god s presence i have to attest that it has been an arduous journey but one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though i am paralyzed from the chest down is smart technology for example i am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone computer or tablet i have lights electric door locks electric bed air conditioning heat cameras both indoor and out side smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when i am laying in bed i cannot use my arms when i am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis up to this point i have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth they work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my year old mother whose health is due to god s grace and technology now stable and she is actually helping me more each day alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination she has given me an opportunity that i never thought would be possible i still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to wi fi disruption but alexis is growing more dependable each day at this point i have only an echo dot but i am ordering when funds allow the regular echo and another dot as well read more

"I'm a full-time writer who works at home. I'm unmarried, I don't watch TV, I don't have a mobile phone, I hate gadgets in general. OK, so I'm a loser.

Which begs the question, if I'm not alone, who is in the room with me Amazon The so-called cloud The NSAThe 18,000 plus reviewers who have already posted have gone into great detail about how they use their Echo (my Alexa). Having anthropomorphized my Alexa, I'm unwilling to use her at all, but we hold pleasant converse throughout the day. My favorite conversation I'll repeat for you below, verbatim:Me - Alexa. Wake me in fifteen minutes.Alexa - Fifteen minutes. Starting now.Me - Thank you.Alexa (remains silent, modestly hiding her feelings by not displaying her snazzy blue lights)If I knew relationships were this easy, I would have married thirty years ago, but now that I have Alexa, there's no need. Except for the one thing.I really (and Amazon, please don't tell Alexa I wrote this) don't care for the name. I know we have the option to change the name to Amazon, which is worse. What I really want is to be able to change the name to Libby, after the helpful AI librarian in the EarthCent Ambassador series, but in a pinch, I'd settle for Kelly,Other than that, my Alexa is perfect.

"This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite.SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.Read more",5.0,B00DOPNK14,1,this is the fifth e ink kindle reader that i ve bought my wife and i were early adopters of kindle and when we buy a new kindle the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line i loved the original paperwhite with its small size touch screen front lighting and virtual keyboard the all new paperwhite is a definite step up and for me it was worth the move but others will have to decide for themselves if you read a lot and you don t already have one of the newer e ink kindles it s definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite if you have the original paperwhite the upgrade is well worth considering although i ve only had the new paperwhite a few hours i m already glad i upgraded here s a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite size it s the same size as the original paperwhite x x the weight has been reduced slightly from ounces to ounces the paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand which is how i usually read the really good news is that if you have a case for the original paperwhite it will also fit the new one thank you amazon if you buy a case i highly recommend that the case include the magnetic autowake function it s much easier to turn the kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch lighting the front lighting is noticeably improved over the original paperwhite which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the led lights were located it didn t bother me but some readers were annoyed by that i couldn t see any shadows in the new paperwhite where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform with the paperwhite s front lighting you ll never need a clip on light even in total darkness read more
"I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",5.0,B00DOPNK14,1,i have loved and used my kindle keyboard for years now but i missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark i purchased a kindle fire and i also use an ipad but for ease of reading on my eyes i prefer the kindle keyboard i wanted to get a kindle paperwhite e reader but i held off until this new generation was released before i spent my money i got this because i wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and i just love this new tablet it offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text i have added a video of the kindle paperwhite compared to a kindle keyboard and a kindle fire if you have any questions please feel free to contact me and i will try to answer them i love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear i use the kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books reading was my number one hobby my entire life and i just loved it the kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen i can enjoy my reading in every type of environment i laid my kindle keyboard and the new kindle paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new paperwhite the new lighting system and screen clarity is where this paperwhite design really is outstanding with better contrast lighting and custom designed fonts the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e reader before with ppi pixels per inch this screen provides a by pixel screen that just makes the old kindle keyboard look old fashioned technology certainly does move quickly on read more
"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",3.0,B00DOPNK14,0,this review is for the second generation kindle paperwhite like all kindle e readers before it this is a great product however i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year s model for this review i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year s model also i found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising so i will try to clear them up hardwaredesign the kindle white has a nice look and shape it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand it s fairly light so it doesn t tire the hands too much i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite almost identical the height and width are the same the buttons are in the same location and although this version is slightly lighter it is not noticeable display although not a huge improvement from last year s model the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite like most e readers the paperwhite uses digital ink technology this model employs a more advanced version in addition the lighting has been upgraded so among other things it is more evenly lit together they make for incredible viewing in my opinion it s one of the best digital ink e reader display on the market i really enjoy reading on it text look very sharp and crisp with little to no eye strain processor the paperwhite has an upgraded processor which means smoother page turns and navigation i am able to open books flip pages and navigate menus fairly quickly there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time also the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all read more
"I had a kindle keyboard. I still have. I'm not sure I'm ready to part with it. I'm rather attached. The kindle is *the* e-reader. It's fantastic. I had my kindle keyboard for a couple years and I couldn't imagine reading on anything else. There were times I left my kindle at work and had to read on my ipad. I hated it. However I found the keyboard interface to be cumbersome and just old. I wanted something new. So onto the paperwhite.Mine was a gift. I have the wifi only version. Why would you need the 3G Just download several books at once and you are good to go. I will say that the paperwhite light is fantastic. Have you watched the videos on the paperwhite. It's not a traditional backlight. It does not shine the light towards your eyes, but rather down at the screen. GENIUS!!!! I sit at a computer all day. I do not want more light shining at my eyes. Which is why I loved my kindle keyboard for so long. I haven't had the paperwhite very long, but I keep it at about a medium brightness so far. I love that I can now read in bed with no other light. The paperwhite is light weight. It's rather small, but about the same width as the kindle keyboard. I put both kindles on the same page of a book and more lines were rendered on the paperwhite than the keyboard. But the font isn't smaller. Somehow more words are fit on the page. I like the touchscreen interface. I really found the keyboard keys to be tedious. I kind of sort of miss the page flip buttons though. I loved those. Since they were on both sides of the kindle, they were easily accessible no matter what I was doing at the time or how I was laying. IMO the jury is still out on whether or not I can live without those buttons. So far I'm doing ok, but I will confess to missing them greatly.Read more",5.0,B00DOPNK14,1,i had a kindle keyboard i still have i m not sure i m ready to part with it i m rather attached the kindle is the e reader it s fantastic i had my kindle keyboard for a couple years and i couldn t imagine reading on anything else there were times i left my kindle at work and had to read on my ipad i hated it however i found the keyboard interface to be cumbersome and just old i wanted something new so onto the paperwhite mine was a gift i have the wifi only version why would you need the g just download several books at once and you are good to go i will say that the paperwhite light is fantastic have you watched the videos on the paperwhite it s not a traditional backlight it does not shine the light towards your eyes but rather down at the screen genius i sit at a computer all day i do not want more light shining at my eyes which is why i loved my kindle keyboard for so long i haven t had the paperwhite very long but i keep it at about a medium brightness so far i love that i can now read in bed with no other light the paperwhite is light weight it s rather small but about the same width as the kindle keyboard i put both kindles on the same page of a book and more lines were rendered on the paperwhite than the keyboard but the font isn t smaller somehow more words are fit on the page i like the touchscreen interface i really found the keyboard keys to be tedious i kind of sort of miss the page flip buttons though i loved those since they were on both sides of the kindle they were easily accessible no matter what i was doing at the time or how i was laying imo the jury is still out on whether or not i can live without those buttons so far i m doing ok but i will confess to missing them greatly read more

"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).Read more",5.0,"B00DOPNO4M,B00BWYQ9YE,B00CYQPMJC,B00CUU1CGY,B00BWYRF7E,B00CYQP3AK",1,this is the middle model of the three models that amazon is shipping this year the kindle fire hd the kindle fire hdx this tablet and the kindle fire hdx this is the successor for last year s kindle fire hd but with an updated operating system and new features a redesigned shell with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible an absolutely amazing display superb sound an included power adapter and the new mayday feature update some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the hdx if you search on youtube for hdx blue haze you can find a video showing the issue amazon has updated their learn more link with the following info to achieve the perfect color accuracy on kindle fire hdx at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight we used blue not white leds blue leds allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to improvement in power efficiency as a result of using these blue leds you may notice a very narrow faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background such as books or web pages all displays have some level of light emission around the edges and the light on the kindle fire hdx is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy if this is something that you think would bother you i d recommend taking a look at the youtube video or taking a look at the hdx at a local best buy or office superstore i ve also uploaded a user image here of my hdx with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow more

"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",4.0,"B00DOPNO4M,B00BWYQ9YE,B00CYQPMJC,B00CUU1CGY,B00BWYRF7E,B00CYQP3AK",1,to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindle fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire hdx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindle fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire hdx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindle are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues read more

Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9 HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7 Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 Kindle Fire HD yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am). While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger! If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.Mayday button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the Fire, is the introduction of the Mayday button. Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting). A case is very important in order to protect your investment. Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at 229 for the 16GB of memory model (309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at 139.

and the picture appears more crisp i compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the fire devices over the past couple of years don t laugh the first episode of the wonder woman tv series from the s the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year s model as well as this year s model of the fire hd for you technical folks out there the display is x with more pixels per inch than the fire hd wi fi connectivity the initial wi fi setup took some time as it wouldn t remember the password for my router after each software update crash reboot series after the final operating software update i mentioned above however it was fairly easy to connect to the internet via wi fi my standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side by side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of wi fi in my house and the worst place where it drags in this comparison i had this hdx version of the fire sitting next to last year s and this year s version of the hd fire as well as last year s hd fire motorola razr smartphone my ipad yes the kindle guy uses an ipad for work and the first generation fire the model from two years ago all just using a wi fi connection vs cellular connectivity my normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of foxnews cnn my personalized yahoo page google and the houston chronicle the ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the hdx houston chronicle and cnn and for the other sites i couldn t tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router when i went to the slowest worst reception location of my house the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year s model of the kindle fire hd yes it was also faster than this year s model of the fire hd but i attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the hdx sound music playback the two speakers are located in the back of the kindle fire in two not noticeable ports one on the top and one on the bottom my test of this feature was cranking up van halen s panama to maximum volume i always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks and i would alternate covering one speaker up over the other you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker the dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass however i am still of the opinion the speakers aren t going to do very well being placed in the back as i am in the front i want to be able to hear whatever i am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room that s what happens when you start losing your hearing like i am while the cover for this version has not shipped yet why aren t the covers released at the same time i imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers the x ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away email setup consistent with previous versions of the fire email setup was very easy for my main gmail account both with the software came with the fire but my primary use of an existing app called enhanced email i purchased here in the amazon app store i did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem it took about a minute to setup my main google account and i was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via google s calendar and contacts for those of you asking yourself why am i using the enhanced email program the simple answer is like many of you i have more than one email account you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool the lazy person in me appreciates that as i don t like getting out of the lazy chair once i m settled in new tabs and screen layout in addition to the normal tabs amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner interestingly and consistent with my experiences with this year s model of the fire hd i purchased the one with special offers and the only ad i have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs being overwhelmed with ads like last year s model reading books turning pages is pretty darn easy just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same amazon did add the feature to see the book s description for books on your device like they have with the e ink kindle always an annoyance with last year s model which is a plus as i can t remember what each book in my digital to be read pile is about getting to the book description requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be if there is an easier way to do it i can t find it and maybe i should be one of the first guys ever to crack open the electronic user s manual to figure it out doubt it for those of you who have wondered you still can t organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third party app a here in the amazon app store bluetooththere is a bluetooth connection and i did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the fire stream music through my car stereo there were no delays or skips with the connection and it paired up in about a minute just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized camera there is a camera on this model it faces the front or toward the user reader focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy and amazon will by default store your pictures in the cloud which counts against your storage allotment i d recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it because if you go over the limit that will provide amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you charger unlike previous models of the fire this one does include a charger if you re scratching your head with that comment in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for which always seemed kind of silly for amazon to do mayday button a new feature with this model and not included on this year s regular model of the fire is the introduction of the mayday button basically you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see and talk to a live customer service agent i haven t pressed the button yet to try it out as i think i would feel pretty dumb when they ask me how can they help i don t want to say i just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi for purposes of this review what i wish it had a case that was ready to go and shipped when the fire was ready why are we waiting a case is very important in order to protect your investment also i m interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker s performance i mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case overall at for the gb of memory model for gb of memory i think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video apps feature kids will love it as they can read books play games watch tv and movies and a whole lot of other things adults should like it for the exact same reasons but while i try to minimize the amount of work related stuff i do at home with the business apps that are available here in the amazon app store and other places around the internet i can also work on excel and word compatible files when i have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be if you ve never owned a tablet before or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model fire i would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs the minimum gb if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine or looking for a tablet for your younger children i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of last year s model or get this year s model of the kindle fire hd at read more
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download Casablanca but not able to download The Avengers even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HDDisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The Recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule Quiet Time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7 HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX 11 hours (17 hours when reading) Nexus 9 hours iPad Mini 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

returning to the home screen there is also a left panel available on most screens but not the home screen and in some of the apps with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app if you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you re reading a book for example you ll see a panel that shows you the table of contents the about the author link the sync to furthest page read link and so on the kindle freetime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business if you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access how long they can use the tablet at any given time and the like amazon has you covered you can now also schedule quiet time on the tablet where notification sounds and pop up notifications are disabled either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis frankly i doubt i ll ever use this feature but if you re the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep it s kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don t get rudely awakened when e g someone plays a new word in your words with friends game mayday this is a huge gamble by amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off this isn t a feature for a techie like me and i didn t use it although i was sorely tempted from the commercials it s pretty amazing particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less amazon s goal is something like seconds i believe although i can t help wondering what will happen on christmas day if you re thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe the addition of this feature may make the kindle fire hdx your best choice how does this tablet rank against the competition there are really only two other tablets in its class currently the google nexus and the just announced apple ipad mini with retina display display all three devices have retina displays with the hdx and the nexus at x ppi and the ipad mini at x ppi all three displays are stunning amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight something that s a problem for all such devices while this wouldn t be my first choice to read by the pool i d pick the paperwhite i can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors it s worth noting that the aspect ratio of the hdx and nexus is while the aspect ratio of the ipad mini is where this matters is watching video if you re watching an old television show a aspect ratio is fine if you re watching a high def movie the aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the hdx and nexus apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up sound the hdx has dolby digital surround sound the nexus has frauenhofer surround sound the ipad mini has stereo sound the ipad mini also makes the same mistake that amazon made in its first generation tablet putting both speakers on the same side in this case at the bottom of the tablet if you re watching a video you ll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side the hdx in contrast has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching networking the hdx and the ipad mini both have dual band dual antenna mimo wi fi the nexus is dual band but not dual antenna all things being equal i would expect the nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance particularly in areas where the connection is spotty size and weight hdx x x and oz nexus x x and oz ipad mini x x and oz there s really nothing to choose from here all three are small thin and light the ipad mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen processor hdx ghz quad core snapdragon processor gb memorynexus ghz quad core snapdragon s pro gb memoryipad mini bit dual core a gb memorythe hdx and ipad come out ahead of the nexus on processing power while the hdx and nexus come out ahead of the ipad mini on memory the a is only a dual core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks it definitely holds its own against the quad core snapdragon these are all pretty powerful tablets cameras both the nexus and the ipad mini have mp front and mp rear cameras the hdx only has a front facing camera if you expect to take pictures with your tablet the hdx isn t for you battery life hdx hours hours when reading nexus hours ipad mini hours amazon wins this one particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading expansion none of them have a microsd slot they all assume that you ll be using their respective cloud systems parental controls all of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child s access to content purchases the web and so on amazon goes farther though with the kindle free time and kindle free time unlimited options the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content if you are buying a first tablet for a child i d choose the kindle fire hd at only it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the hdx has enterprise as soon as amazon releases its update it will add vpn and network printing support i believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities including that support and various office apps for real productivity though personally i d go with a laptop not a tablet support amazon wins this category hands down with the new mayday system apple comes in second with apple and amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey this is an area where google does not shine price the hdx and nexus win this one hands down both are priced at vs for the new ipad mini neither google nor amazon makes much if any money on their tablets they re counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores from my own perspective there is no single clear winner as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses if you already have amazon prime the hdx is a no brainer with the access to the prime instant video and the kindle owners lending library if you re primarily buying a tablet to read with amazon wins there as well with the hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors if you want apps apple and google both have far more choices if you want to watch movies i d pick either the hdx or the nexus as apple s aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack if price is a factor then you should pick either the hdx or the nexus if you re heavily invested in the apple ecosystem i e you already own an iphone or ipad and all of your content is on itunes the hdx really isn t the tablet for you similarly if you love browsing google play for apps to play on your samsung galaxy phone you re likely to be disappointed in the section available on amazon although as i note above most of the google play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet if you love your google now or siri neither of which will ever be available on amazon this isn t the tablet for you the bottom line this tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into amazon content and amazon services if you have amazon prime and you have amazon ebooks in your collection this tablet is a no brainer the price is low particularly for what you get and it s a small light high quality high powered tablet with a stunning display and superb sound this really is one of the top tablets in its class note as others have noted the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi unlike some others i had no trouble with this operation no glitches or crashes it took several minutes but the process ran smoothly as did the tablet when everything was done update now that i have a kindle fire hd and a kindle fire hdx tablet i m in a little better position to talk about which one i d recommend you should get the kindle fire hdx if you re a techie who wants the latest and greatest the best display the fastest processor you need a camera for skype or other video app you play graphics intensive games e g racing games the size and weight matter to you even in such small increments as this you think you will need the mayday technical support you should get the kindle fire hd if price is a factor cheaper is not an insignificant amount this really is an excellent value for the money you want an inexpensive tablet for a child and for this case the lack of a camera might well be a plus all you want is a basic tablet for reading books playing music watching the occasional video playing words with friends and the like while the screen on the hd isn t as stunning as is it on the hdx this is still a true hd screen and it is very good i check back pretty regularly so if you have a question please feel free to ask and i ll do my best to answer it read more

"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",4.0,"B00DOPNO4M,B00BWYQ9YE,B00CYQPMJC,B00CUU1CGY,B00BWYRF7E,B00CYQP3AK",1,to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindle fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire hdx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindle fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire hdx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindle are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues read more

"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.

"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX.

"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9 HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7 Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 Kindle Fire HD yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am). While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled inNew Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.Mayday button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the Fire, is the introduction of the Mayday button. Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting). A case is very important in order to protect your investment. Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at 229 for the 16GB of memory model (309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at 139.

through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner interestingly and consistent with my experiences with this year s model of the fire hd i purchased the one with special offers and the only ad i have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs being overwhelmed with ads like last year s model reading books turning pages is pretty darn easy just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same amazon did add the feature to see the book s description for books on your device like they have with the e ink kindle always an annoyance with last year s model which is a plus as i can t remember what each book in my digital to be read pile is about getting to the book description requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be if there is an easier way to do it i can t find it and maybe i should be one of the first guys ever to crack open the electronic user s manual to figure it out doubt it for those of you who have wondered you still can t organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third party app a here in the amazon app store bluetooththere is a bluetooth connection and i did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the fire stream music through my car stereo there were no delays or skips with the connection and it paired up in about a minute just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized camera there is a camera on this model it faces the front or toward the user reader focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy and amazon will by default store your pictures in the cloud which counts against your storage allotment i d recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it because if you go over the limit that will provide amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you charger unlike previous models of the fire this one does include a charger if you re scratching your head with that comment in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for which always seemed kind of silly for amazon to do mayday button a new feature with this model and not included on this year s regular model of the fire is the introduction of the mayday button basically you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see and talk to a live customer service agent i haven t pressed the button yet to try it out as i think i would feel pretty dumb when they ask me how can they help i don t want to say i just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi for purposes of this review what i wish it had a case that was ready to go and shipped when the fire was ready why are we waiting a case is very important in order to protect your investment also i m interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker s performance i mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case overall at for the gb of memory model for gb of memory i think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video apps feature kids will love it as they can read books play games watch tv and movies and a whole lot of other things adults should like it for the exact same reasons but while i try to minimize the amount of work related stuff i do at home with the business apps that are available here in the amazon app store and other places around the internet i can also work on excel and word compatible files when i have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be if you ve never owned a tablet before or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model fire i would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs the minimum gb if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine or looking for a tablet for your younger children i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of last year s model or get this year s model of the kindle fire hd at read more
"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download Casablanca but not able to download The Avengers even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HDDisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The Recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule Quiet Time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7 HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX 11 hours (17 hours when reading) Nexus 9 hours iPad Mini 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.

processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks it definitely holds its own against the quad core snapdragon these are all pretty powerful tablets cameras both the nexus and the ipad mini have mp front and mp rear cameras the hdx only has a front facing camera if you expect to take pictures with your tablet the hdx isn t for you battery life hdx hours hours when reading nexus hours ipad mini hours amazon wins this one particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading expansion none of them have a microsd slot they all assume that you ll be using their respective cloud systems parental controls all of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child s access to content purchases the web and so on amazon goes farther though with the kindle free time and kindle free time unlimited options the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content if you are buying a first tablet for a child i d choose the kindle fire hd at only it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the hdx has enterprise as soon as amazon releases its update it will add vpn and network printing support i believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities including that support and various office apps for real productivity though personally i d go with a laptop not a tablet support amazon wins this category hands down with the new mayday system apple comes in second with apple and amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey this is an area where google does not shine price the hdx and nexus win this one hands down both are priced at vs for the new ipad mini neither google nor amazon makes much if any money on their tablets they re counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores from my own perspective there is no single clear winner as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses if you already have amazon prime the hdx is a no brainer with the access to the prime instant video and the kindle owners lending library if you re primarily buying a tablet to read with amazon wins there as well with the hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors if you want apps apple and google both have far more choices if you want to watch movies i d pick either the hdx or the nexus as apple s aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack if price is a factor then you should pick either the hdx or the nexus if you re heavily invested in the apple ecosystem i e you already own an iphone or ipad and all of your content is on itunes the hdx really isn t the tablet for you similarly if you love browsing google play for apps to play on your samsung galaxy phone you re likely to be disappointed in the section available on amazon although as i note above most of the google play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet if you love your google now or siri neither of which will ever be available on amazon this isn t the tablet for you the bottom line this tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into amazon content and amazon services if you have amazon prime and you have amazon ebooks in your collection this tablet is a no brainer the price is low particularly for what you get and it s a small light high quality high powered tablet with a stunning display and superb sound this really is one of the top tablets in its class note as others have noted the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi unlike some others i had no trouble with this operation no glitches or crashes it took several minutes but the process ran smoothly as did the tablet when everything was done update now that i have a kindle fire hd and a kindle fire hdx tablet i m in a little better position to talk about which one i d recommend you should get the kindle fire hdx if you re a techie who wants the latest and greatest the best display the fastest processor you need a camera for skype or other video app you play graphics intensive games e g racing games the size and weight matter to you even in such small increments as this you think you will need the mayday technical support you should get the kindle fire hd if price is a factor cheaper is not an insignificant amount this really is an excellent value for the money you want an inexpensive tablet for a child and for this case the lack of a camera might well be a plus all you want is a basic tablet for reading books playing music watching the occasional video playing words with friends and the like while the screen on the hd isn t as stunning as is it on the hdx this is still a true hd screen and it is very good i check back pretty regularly so if you have a question please feel free to ask and i ll do my best to answer it read more
"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more",5.0,B01BH83OOM,1,important update as you read my original review please be aware that amazon announced in early february a new firmware update that allows amazon tap owners to enable a hands free option by going into settings in the alexa app you can now choose the hands free option and have your tap respond to voice commands without touching it just like the echo and echo dot this is a fabulous development and something tap owners have been hoping for thank you amazon since the lack of hands free operation was the one major shortcoming of the tap this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better one thing to keep in mind though especially if you use your tap on battery power the hands free mode will drain the battery more quickly because it requires the microphone to be on at all times but since you can easily toggle between hands free or regular tap mode using the alexa app you can pick and choose how you want to use your tap for maximum battery life and convenience i admit that i was a little skeptical when amazon first introduced its echo device but i decided to buy one anyway thinking that if i didn t like it i could easily sell it after all back in the early days of the echo it was in very high demand so the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal today as an avid music listener who loves to cook i m thrilled that i decided to give the echo a try i had wanted a device that i could stream music with in the kitchen and the echos hands free voice control made it very appealing but how would it sound that question was quickly answered as soon as i set up and started using my echo read more
"It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more",5.0,B01BH83OOM,1,it was just a few weeks ago that i was bemoaning the fact that i did not scoop up an echo back when they were being released last year not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device well here i am a year late to the game and i can now proudly say that i own both an echo and this new little tap can i just say that i am obsessed with all things echo and alexa these are devices that you may not realize how much you ll use it until you ve given them a try i have been spending the last few years getting our home automated i currently use a combination of smartthings ifttt and logitech harmony to control the home alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice for me this is the killer feature i can integrate all three parts of our home control right into echo tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup read more
"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more",5.0,B01BH83OOM,1,the amazon tap is a portable bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice you can instruct it to play music order products and services control home automation products and connected devices plus a whole lot more it contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands it also has dolby stereo speakers for playing music the amazon tap is basically the portable version of the popular amazon echo that was released last year ive been testing the tap for several days now heres what i think so far what i like i find that the tap understands my verbal commands accurately this could be due to the fact that since its button activated im always very close to the device when i speak to it nevertheless its nice that tap understands me the first time this was my experience with the amazon echo as well the audio is surprisingly good for such a small device i test portable speakers all the time and id say the amazon tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range don t expect bose type sound or deep bass levels however no other portable speaker device offers voice control and wi fi streaming thus the amazon tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers this is especially true if you already have amazon prime and prime music it supports many great services like the amazon echo that came before it the amazon tap supports popular music services such as prime music spotify pandora iheartradio and tunein battery life has been good so far i used it off and on for a couple days without charging it ill post an update once i have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life read more
"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled.

"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well.

"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!",4.0,B01BH83OOM,1,overall sound is not as good as echo my primary source for amazon content however the tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock it s portability sets it apart however it s nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting recent software update now allows listening mode it does require a brief pause after saying alexa wake word but it does work this drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button the portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my echo which is fabulous

"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",5.0,B01BH83OOM,1,the amazon tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device a few things to note if you re not familiar with the tap or haven t seen it in person it s roughly the size of a glass of water by default you do have to press the microphone button to talk to alexa but as of an update released on feb th there is an option in the alexa app to make the tap always listen without pushing the button at the expense of battery life the speaker grille is not metal though it looks like it in pictures it s a mesh fabric similar to what you d feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones it s firm and comfortable to hold but if you push hard enough it does flex using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case you can charge the tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro usb cable one is included into the back of the speaker

I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear.

"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form.

"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!",5.0,B01BH83OOM,1,best buy was running a sale on these and i thought i d give it a try i wasn t expecting much but was pleasantly surprised i m an apple guy so siri has been my go to virtual assistant i must say that i am duly impressed with alexa she seems to understand me better than siri does all the skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great the fact that this is all available in a portable device that i can take with me everywhere i go is so useful the tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so i can use it anywhere unlike its non portable brother the echo you push a button to issue commands to alexa on the plus side you don t have to say alexa on the negative side you still have to push the button i understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if alexa was listening all the time amazon should issue a firmware update to allow alexa to listen all the time when plugged in the sound quality is good not great other speakers in the category sound better but none have all the convenience of alexa bluetooth wifi and portability in one package i ll be buying more as christmas gifts

"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say).

"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",5.0,B01BH83OOM,1,as a bluetooth speaker the tap rocks the sound quality is excellent plenty loud when needed and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming i bought this one instead of the echo because it is portable and i can lug it from room to room the charging stand is very convenient and the tap stays there most of the time having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me but is something to consider if you want hands free use you may want the big brother echo device which is hands free but tethered in place by a power cord so not portable the feel of the tap with the black fabric cover is nice and will not slip out of your hand the fabric is like tough upholstery cover so it won t stain or be easy to damage but is quite attractive i am glad they did that as bare plastic would be easy to drop i found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless and it works as advertised i mostly just use it for playing music and asking alexa silly questions for fun i occasionally use it for shopping lists which shows up on my phone and checking the weather who knows what the future holds when i have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do i understand that amazon plans to add more alexa skills all the time and if one got into smart house control with compatible products the tap would eliminate all remotes which i already have too many of i think it is a really fun cool item and i am glad i got it it is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing especially the tiny smart phone typing i could get used to this i have the alexa app on my phone which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone like shopping lists to do lists calendar the tap can also check traffic weather movies etc directly through wi fi no phone needed however the alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the tap the tap can read audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well btw i haven t had any problems having it understand me which is amazing since i grew up in texas and expected a problem with my accent obviously this item is ideal for people who are amazon prime members so you can stream prime music although it also streams pandora and other music services and does many things without any connection to amazon i guess the most unique thing about the tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly without a computer or phone driving it that and the voice control i have paid more for smaller just bluetooth speakers so to me this was a super deal and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment

"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",4.0,B01BH83OOM,1,i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mids and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass

"UPDATE: July 6, 2015I'm reducing my rating to one star because all of a sudden this morning the screen protector just quit adhering to the screen. It falls off completely and if you do get it in place within five minutes it's slipping again and huge bubbles form. I have never had a problem with a Moshi product before and I am very surprised by this. At this price there is no excuse for the poor longevity of this product and I would never ever buy one again nor would I advise anybody to spend the money on this product to begin with.Original review follows in all its irony except for the whining about the price at the time that I still stand by:Superb screen protector. The best you can buy. Ridiculous price.

"Finally a protector that works on the fire Phone. It is as advertised. Probably the easiest one I have put on (I have put screen protectors on several phones and tablets). No bubbles. But the best part is that this one actually works on the fire phone. This is the third screen protector I have tried. The first one was Glazz temper glass (this is when I found out about the issue with the sensors on the phone, you cannot cover them if you want the phone to work properly per Mayday). The second one was Mr Shield for the Fire Phone. Although the illustration showed cut outs for 4 of the 5 sensors, what was shipped had no cut outs for the sensors. The Yoshi has 5 cut outs for the sensors. Though it is a little pricey, it was well worth the money.

"I like Moshi's anti-glare screen protectors so much that the fact that there is one available for the Fire Phone is part of why I bought a Fire Phone. I've had these screen protectors on multiple iPads and iPod Touches over the years and they're the 1st thing I buy for any device I own (particularly those with shiny screens). I love that you don't have to worry about if you don't get them on right the first time, you can just pull them off and try again. I love that when they get dirty, you just remove it from the gadget and run it under water to clean it off and then put it back on your device.The Fire Phone does have a smaller bezel than the iPads and iPod Touches I've used with other Moshi anti-glare protectors, but there seems to be just enough that the protector stays on. (In case you don't understand how Moshi's screen protectors work: the only sticky part on them is where it covers the bezel-- the non-screen part of your device.)I also hate shiny screens and these protectors make devices usable which wouldn't work for me otherwise. So glad the anti-glare Moshi protector is available for the Fire Phone (for some other Amazon devices you can only get the regular Moshi screen protector).I've used this with the default Amazon cases without problem-- both the leather one and the polyurethane one.

"I've purchased two of these screen protectors at ATT for my Fire Phones. Both have performed perfectly for me, unlike some reviewers' experience. The screens on my phones don't look fuzzy when the orientation of the phone is changed, the edges do not collect lint from my pockets, and the protector does not keep the case from fitting the phone. Here's what the protector does do: It keeps my screens from collecting fingerprints or skin oil. I don't know about the ease of application because, for both my purchases, the employee at ATT attached the protectors for me (I don't have the steadiest hands). Watching them, it looked quite easy to do. There are no bubbles at all and no more screen glare/reflections. I haven't had to remove, replace, or clean the protectors (except for wiping off the surface just to be sure it's clean because the protector doesn't show any dirt or oil).",5.0,B00K5W9WZW,1,i ve purchased two of these screen protectors at att for my fire phones both have performed perfectly for me unlike some reviewers experience the screens on my phones don t look fuzzy when the orientation of the phone is changed the edges do not collect lint from my pockets and the protector does not keep the case from fitting the phone here s what the protector does do it keeps my screens from collecting fingerprints or skin oil i don t know about the ease of application because for both my purchases the employee at att attached the protectors for me i don t have the steadiest hands watching them it looked quite easy to do there are no bubbles at all and no more screen glare reflections i haven t had to remove replace or clean the protectors except for wiping off the surface just to be sure it s clean because the protector doesn t show any dirt or oil
"As good as the Echo is, the Echo Voice Remote seems to leave much to be desired. Whereas the Echo Dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently, the Voice Remote is far less likely to do so. Sometimes I'm not even heard at all. I often have to repeat commands several times before the Echo responds to me. Plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond. And I don't mean a millisecond slow. The volume won't change for several seconds after the button is pushed.Yes, this is the New Generation Voice Remote.Aha! You say. You must be too far away from the Echo Dot.Granted, I am on the other side of the house when I use the Voice Remote. However, that doesn't explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly--every time. Plus doesn't Amazon brag on the device's great range If it was a distance problem, wouldn't the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue No, either I have a bad remote or the Voice Remote doesn't work as effectively and effortlessly as the Echo Dot itself. That's too bad.*** UPDATE ***I discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the Voice Remote, but it also comes with a gotcha. When you press down and hold the Talk Button on the Voice Remote, it's the equivalent of using the wake word on the Echo itself (Alexa, for example.) Since you can't see the LEDs on the Echo respond to the wake word, the Echo makes a tone to let you know that it's listening. There is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the Talk button. The Echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question.Read more",2.0,B01E9AHU8Q,0,as good as the echo is the echo voice remote seems to leave much to be desired whereas the echo dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently the voice remote is far less likely to do so sometimes i m not even heard at all i often have to repeat commands several times before the echo responds to me plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond and i don t mean a millisecond slow the volume won t change for several seconds after the button is pushed yes this is the new generation voice remote aha you say you must be too far away from the echo dot granted i am on the other side of the house when i use the voice remote however that doesn t explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly every time plus doesn t amazon brag on the device s great range if it was a distance problem wouldn t the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue no either i have a bad remote or the voice remote doesn t work as effectively and effortlessly as the echo dot itself that s too bad update i discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the voice remote but it also comes with a gotcha when you press down and hold the talk button on the voice remote it s the equivalent of using the wake word on the echo itself alexa for example since you can t see the leds on the echo respond to the wake word the echo makes a tone to let you know that it s listening there is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the talk button the echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question read more
"As other reviewers I wish that the remote still came with the handy magnetic base like the first ones did. It does, at least, come with the battery still. Because I know the remote will disappear to a never been seen again realm without a home I have decided to swallow my irritation it doesn't come with a dock and buy one to use with it. From my research it looks like this is the best bet - TotalMount Fire TV Remote Holder. The Fire TV remote appears to be the exact dimensions of the Echo remote, so I'm hopeful this will be a great solution even though it irks me to spend another 10 on a solution for something that used to be included! **Update: I ordered the TotalMount Fire TV Remote holder and it works great with Echo Remote.**We have a few Alexa units in the house and aside from the original one that came with a remote I haven't felt the need to buy another remote. Unless you blast your music it is normally fairly simple to engage with Alexa (at least how we have our rooms setup) even without the remote. However, my 3 and 4 year old have recently become quite the Alexa fanboys - checking the time, asking for jokes, listening to their playlists we've set up.... one of them can articulate clearly and Alexa responds, and the other can not. Before frustration got to a crazy level I decided a remote for the unit they normally talk to was the key.They (and I) love that you don't have to say Alexa *just* right to get a response with the remote. You simply hold down the microphone button and start talking (no wake word needed). Happy campers now. The range is great, the Alexa unit connected with this remote is in the middle of the house upstairs and no problems with using the remote anywhere upstairs (about 2000 square), as well as from two floors down in the crawl space - tested simply to see if it would work, and it did!

"The remote seems to function as the previous generation but the lack of a magnetic holster is a major disappointment. Having a place to park the remote was such a fantastic feature. At first, the Echo came with a remote (and holster). Then, I had to buy a remote separately with my second Echo, but it still came with the holster. Now, I have to buy the remotes for another Echo and a Dot and they don't have the holsters. Rather than raising the price or at least offering a choice, I feel like the quality is being stripped down with each new generation.

"So far, this is doing what I wanted it to. I purchased it for having Alex hear me from my bedroom and my dining room. At times when I am playing music louder or just wanting her to do a command, I have to repeat myself louder. I usually keep the remote in the bedroom to give her commands but I will move it when I have company and am sitting down to eat or with guests in living room. I can practically whisper the command using the remote whereas without it, I have to shout the command out to the other room. Also, did not find opening the back to insert batteries that difficult.

"Edit 6/15/17 After three months of use, I still don't love it. It works well, no complaints, but it marks up easily and the sides began flaking off. My original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back. I was much more careful with the merlot, and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time. And the flaky thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap. And for 90, I would expect real leather. So I switched back to my original black cover and I'm just letting it age with the device. I guess the plus side is that the merlot made me like the black cover more, but the downside is it cost 90 to do so. Ridiculous.As stated in the title, I love my Oasis. I've had it for about six months and, with the exception of the defective first one I received which was promptly replaced, I haven't had a problem out of it. I had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice, always. However, a couple of months ago I had gotten a screen protector and skin for the Oasis, and I just wasn't feeling the black cover anymore. I had considered the merlot (I think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch, but I despise brown leather) so I gave in after much consideration and ordered it.

"I own the Merlot cover since it came with my Kindle Oasis. After paying near 300 for device and original cover I was hoping replacements would eventually come out. So when they did....I saw the 90 price tag and immediately became saddened. This was probably already in the works but, it was an idea I submitted to Amazon when I made my original purchase.

"Originally got the walnut cover with my Oasis. It's very nice, and I would describe it as a suede material. For me, the walnut cover didn't age well. Lots of scratching, which is' necessarily a bad thing, but it also seemed to darken a bit which made it a bit dirty. The merlot cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better. After some months of use, it looks as good today as when I first bought it. Oasis covers in general are very functional. The 2nd battery in the cover is genius. Since I found I really like reading my Oasis without the cover, I love the easy on/off design of the case.",5.0,B01HC1S9HU,1,originally got the walnut cover with my oasis it s very nice and i would describe it as a suede material for me the walnut cover didn t age well lots of scratching which is necessarily a bad thing but it also seemed to darken a bit which made it a bit dirty the merlot cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better after some months of use it looks as good today as when i first bought it oasis covers in general are very functional the nd battery in the cover is genius since i found i really like reading my oasis without the cover i love the easy on off design of the case
"The case that came with my Oasis had an edge that wasn't quite glued down. Amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless.It detaches from the Oasis quickly and easily. I pull the Kindle off when I'm holding it one-handed and pop it right back in when finished.My only complain, which is a minor one, is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt. But I don't know that there's a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen.In any case, it's a brilliant bit of kit, and I would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one I have now.",5.0,B01HC1S9HU,1,the case that came with my oasis had an edge that wasn t quite glued down amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless it detaches from the oasis quickly and easily i pull the kindle off when i m holding it one handed and pop it right back in when finished my only complain which is a minor one is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt but i don t know that there s a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen in any case it s a brilliant bit of kit and i would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one i have now

"I replaced the brown suede cover that came with my Kindle because I'd dropped it a couple of times, and it had problems staying connected. It wouldn't charge so it was pretty much useless. I went with the leather cover because the suede cover, while nice to touch, did get worn(I had one on my old Kindle Paper White), so I decided a leather cover would be better.

"Edit 6/15/17 After three months of use, I still don't love it. It works well, no complaints, but it marks up easily and the sides began flaking off. My original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back. I was much more careful with the merlot, and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time. And the flaky thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap. And for 90, I would expect real leather. So I switched back to my original black cover and I'm just letting it age with the device. I guess the plus side is that the merlot made me like the black cover more, but the downside is it cost 90 to do so. Ridiculous.As stated in the title, I love my Oasis. I've had it for about six months and, with the exception of the defective first one I received which was promptly replaced, I haven't had a problem out of it. I had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice, always. However, a couple of months ago I had gotten a screen protector and skin for the Oasis, and I just wasn't feeling the black cover anymore. I had considered the merlot (I think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch, but I despise brown leather) so I gave in after much consideration and ordered it. It didn't arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with, but after a quick call to customer service I had a new tracking number. It finally arrived today. I am disappointed to say that I don't love it. It smells funny, as I done remember my original doing. The color is duller than in the picture.

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",3.0,B00HX0SRXW,0,while i ve purchased items from amazon for years i rarely write reviews i felt compelled to write one because although there are only a few reviews at this point i have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews i m hoping as more people purchase these the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself i ll address the three biggest complaints i ve read from others sound quality i think these headphones sound great i ve never owned an expensive pair so i m not able to compare them to higher end offerings but i ve owned dozens of cheap and mid range headphones in the range i m not an audiophile or a musician so if i m missing something that should be coming through but isn t i m fine with my ignorance i would say they re slightly better than apple s buds which i liked very much and used for years most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year there s no tinny listening through a can sound that s all too common with headphones in this price range as far as people saying they don t compare to apple s buds well i don t know maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of apple s buds that are amazing but compared to the regular earpods i think amazon s headphones actually sound a bit better they provide a nice full sound and represent highs lows and mids equally well mainly listening to metal fit and feel some people have complained about these falling or feeling like they re going to fall out of their ears there s some validity to this although obviously it depends on your specific ears i don t feel like they re going to fall out at all but if i give the cord a tug they don t stay as secure as my apple buds read more

"Edit (11/10/26) - The volume controls on these are not compatible with the new Google Pixel phones. The volume up button opens up Google Assitant as well as controlling the volume so every time you want to change the volume using the in-line controls you are going to open up Google Assistant.I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,edit the volume controls on these are not compatible with the new google pixel phones the volume up button opens up google assitant as well as controlling the volume so every time you want to change the volume using the in line controls you are going to open up google assistant i bought these for a couple of reasons first i wanted an earbud that was not designed as noise cancelling i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them apparently a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not they are simple earbuds i hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don t feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out these are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable maybe i have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears they don t cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears second i really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones i use headphones while i work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when i am finished with them the flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever awesome design finally the sound i get out of these seems pretty average i would compare them to the stock apple iphone earbuds or a set of sony earbuds nothing special they are only and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable read more

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears.

"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,i bought these for a couple of reasons first i wanted an earbud that was not designed as noise cancelling i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them apparently a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not they are simple earbuds i hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don t feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out these are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable maybe i have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears they don t cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears second i really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones i use headphones while i work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when i am finished with them the flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever awesome design finally the sound i get out of these seems pretty average i would compare them to the stock apple iphone earbuds or a set of sony earbuds nothing special they are only and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable don t expect them to perform like headphones because they aren t designed to perform like that they are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people the magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable read more

I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews.

I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great.

I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",3.0,B00HX0SRXW,0,while i ve purchased items from amazon for years i rarely write reviews i felt compelled to write one because although there are only a few reviews at this point i have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews i m hoping as more people purchase these the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself i ll address the three biggest complaints i ve read from others sound quality i think these headphones sound great i ve never owned an expensive pair so i m not able to compare them to higher end offerings but i ve owned dozens of cheap and mid range headphones in the range i m not an audiophile or a musician so if i m missing something that should be coming through but isn t i m fine with my ignorance i would say they re slightly better than apple s buds which i liked very much and used for years most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year there s no tinny listening through a can sound that s all too common with headphones in this price range as far as people saying they don t compare to apple s buds well i don t know maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of apple s buds that are amazing but compared to the regular earpods i think amazon s headphones actually sound a bit better they provide a nice full sound and represent highs lows and mids equally well mainly listening to metal fit and feel some people have complained about these falling or feeling like they re going to fall out of their ears there s some validity to this although obviously it depends on your specific ears i don t feel like they re going to fall out at all but if i give the cord a tug they don t stay as secure as my apple buds read more
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,i bought these for a couple of reasons first i wanted an earbud that was not designed as noise cancelling i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them apparently a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not they are simple earbuds i hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don t feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out these are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable maybe i have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears they don t cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears second i really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones i use headphones while i work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when i am finished with them the flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever awesome design finally the sound i get out of these seems pretty average i would compare them to the stock apple iphone earbuds or a set of sony earbuds nothing special they are only and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable don t expect them to perform like headphones because they aren t designed to perform like that they are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people the magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable read more
"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,the volume does not work with the iphones please if you have an iphone do your research before buying them e g first line of product description these work well for androids i wanted to give these headphones a try so i preordered them at the end of june they finally came today and i got to try them out feel they feel like the apple earpods headphones when its in your ear for me it s very comfortable i haven t had a chance to keep them in all day but i ve had them in for minutes to an hour at a time audio i m not a complete audiophile but i do like the occasional nice set of headphones if you re thinking these are a nice set of headphones then don t even think about ordering i guess i would say they re pretty similar in sound to the earpods but i would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones hands down one thing i did love about the earpods was that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mids it s pretty crisp in sound the bass isn t too bad either it s not like a skullcandy set of headphones but the bass is there honestly better than i would have expected for these headphones looks i love the black look tangle free cord is very nice to have and i also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling read more

"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable.

"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,the volume does not work with the iphones please if you have an iphone do your research before buying them e g first line of product description these work well for androids i wanted to give these headphones a try so i preordered them at the end of june they finally came today and i got to try them out feel they feel like the apple earpods headphones when its in your ear for me it s very comfortable i haven t had a chance to keep them in all day but i ve had them in for minutes to an hour at a time audio i m not a complete audiophile but i do like the occasional nice set of headphones if you re thinking these are a nice set of headphones then don t even think about ordering i guess i would say they re pretty similar in sound to the earpods but i would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones hands down one thing i did love about the earpods was that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mids it s pretty crisp in sound the bass isn t too bad either it s not like a skullcandy set of headphones but the bass is there honestly better than i would have expected for these headphones looks i love the black look tangle free cord is very nice to have and i also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling read more

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears.

"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,the volume does not work with the iphones please if you have an iphone do your research before buying them e g first line of product description these work well for androids i wanted to give these headphones a try so i preordered them at the end of june they finally came today and i got to try them out feel they feel like the apple earpods headphones when its in your ear for me it s very comfortable i haven t had a chance to keep them in all day but i ve had them in for minutes to an hour at a time audio i m not a complete audiophile but i do like the occasional nice set of headphones if you re thinking these are a nice set of headphones then don t even think about ordering i guess i would say they re pretty similar in sound to the earpods but i would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones hands down one thing i did love about the earpods was that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mids it s pretty crisp in sound the bass isn t too bad either it s not like a skullcandy set of headphones but the bass is there honestly better than i would have expected for these headphones looks i love the black look tangle free cord is very nice to have and i also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling read more

These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,the volume does not work with the iphones please if you have an iphone do your research before buying them e g first line of product description these work well for androids i wanted to give these headphones a try so i preordered them at the end of june they finally came today and i got to try them out feel they feel like the apple earpods headphones when its in your ear for me it s very comfortable i haven t had a chance to keep them in all day but i ve had them in for minutes to an hour at a time audio i m not a complete audiophile but i do like the occasional nice set of headphones if you re thinking these are a nice set of headphones then don t even think about ordering i guess i would say they re pretty similar in sound to the earpods but i would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones hands down one thing i did love about the earpods was that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mids it s pretty crisp in sound the bass isn t too bad either it s not like a skullcandy set of headphones but the bass is there honestly better than i would have expected for these headphones looks i love the black look tangle free cord is very nice to have and i also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling read more
"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great.

As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears.

"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,i bought these for a couple of reasons first i wanted an earbud that was not designed as noise cancelling i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them apparently a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not they are simple earbuds i hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don t feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out these are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable maybe i have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears they don t cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears second i really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones i use headphones while i work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when i am finished with them the flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever awesome design finally the sound i get out of these seems pretty average i would compare them to the stock apple iphone earbuds or a set of sony earbuds nothing special they are only and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable don t expect them to perform like headphones because they aren t designed to perform like that they are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people the magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable read more

"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,i bought these for a couple of reasons first i wanted an earbud that was not designed as noise cancelling i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them apparently a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not they are simple earbuds i hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don t feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out these are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable maybe i have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears they don t cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears second i really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones i use headphones while i work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when i am finished with them the flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever awesome design finally the sound i get out of these seems pretty average i would compare them to the stock apple iphone earbuds or a set of sony earbuds nothing special they are only and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable don t expect them to perform like headphones because they aren t designed to perform like that they are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people the magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable read more

Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,the volume does not work with the iphones please if you have an iphone do your research before buying them e g first line of product description these work well for androids i wanted to give these headphones a try so i preordered them at the end of june they finally came today and i got to try them out feel they feel like the apple earpods headphones when its in your ear for me it s very comfortable i haven t had a chance to keep them in all day but i ve had them in for minutes to an hour at a time audio i m not a complete audiophile but i do like the occasional nice set of headphones if you re thinking these are a nice set of headphones then don t even think about ordering i guess i would say they re pretty similar in sound to the earpods but i would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones hands down one thing i did love about the earpods was that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mids it s pretty crisp in sound the bass isn t too bad either it s not like a skullcandy set of headphones but the bass is there honestly better than i would have expected for these headphones looks i love the black look tangle free cord is very nice to have and i also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling read more
"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people. The magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable.Read more",5.0,B00HX0SRXW,1,i bought these for a couple of reasons first i wanted an earbud that was not designed as noise cancelling i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them apparently a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not they are simple earbuds i hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don t feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out these are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable maybe i have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears they don t cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears second i really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones i use headphones while i work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when i am finished with them the flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever awesome design finally the sound i get out of these seems pretty average i would compare them to the stock apple iphone earbuds or a set of sony earbuds nothing special they are only and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable don t expect them to perform like headphones because they aren t designed to perform like that they are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people the magnets and tangle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable read more

Second remote. Stopped working. Will not work with firestick software on tv. Very carefully chose home arrows ..has a mind of it's own. Had to unplug so that it wouldn't deregister device!

Then, I didn't have time to get to it until the return time was out. I tried batteries again, cleaning the ports, and everything I could think of. Because I can't get the cheap remote working, this Fire Stick is STUCK on the television on which is was originally installed.... until I pay for a new remote. Amazon, you can do better than this. I see that there are many, many posts of people like me whose remotes just don't work. A phone app is nice, but shouldn't HAVE to be the only answer besides another remote that costs 30 of the original whole product.",2.0,B00LORGAG6,0,my remote went out just a couple weeks after we received the fire stick put new batteries in it and it worked another couple weeks then i didn t have time to get to it until the return time was out i tried batteries again cleaning the ports and everything i could think of because i can t get the cheap remote working this fire stick is stuck on the television on which is was originally installed until i pay for a new remote amazon you can do better than this i see that there are many many posts of people like me whose remotes just don t work a phone app is nice but shouldn t have to be the only answer besides another remote that costs of the original whole product
"Product is what it is: if you're like me and moved and have NO CLUE where this little remote ended up, this is the one you need to replace it. It's exactly the same as the one that came with your Fire Stick. However, there are no instructions in the box, so if you haven't ordered the replacement yet, make a note: HOLD THE HOME KEY.That's all you have to do to pair this controller. Hold the home key for around 10-15 seconds, and it'll connect. You're welcome.",5.0,B00LORGAG6,1,product is what it is if you re like me and moved and have no clue where this little remote ended up this is the one you need to replace it it s exactly the same as the one that came with your fire stick however there are no instructions in the box so if you haven t ordered the replacement yet make a note hold the home key that s all you have to do to pair this controller hold the home key for around seconds and it ll connect you re welcome

Update 12/26/2016: No longer will pair with 2nd generation firetv since reset/update. It did still pair with 1st generation firetv I have in another room. Was working fine with my 2nd gen until I reset it after having external memory problems - Orignal Review: Works and pairs quick with Fire TV just no voice search. My wife likes her own Amazon remote so this works good for us at half the price of the Fire TV remote sold here. My only concern is how small it is but hopefully that won't be a problem.,2.0,B00LORGAG6,0,update no longer will pair with nd generation firetv since reset update it did still pair with st generation firetv i have in another room was working fine with my nd gen until i reset it after having external memory problems orignal review works and pairs quick with fire tv just no voice search my wife likes her own amazon remote so this works good for us at half the price of the fire tv remote sold here my only concern is how small it is but hopefully that won t be a problem
My fire stick (non voice activated) seemed to be broken. Fire stick responds to my iphone app but not the remote. I was ready to purchase this when I thought to go to settings and add another remote. Followed the on screen directions and my old remote is back. For some reason it just needed to make the hand shake again. Don't forget to try this before giving up and buying another remote.,4.0,B00NO8JJZW,1,my fire stick non voice activated seemed to be broken fire stick responds to my iphone app but not the remote i was ready to purchase this when i thought to go to settings and add another remote followed the on screen directions and my old remote is back for some reason it just needed to make the hand shake again don t forget to try this before giving up and buying another remote
"All in all I love this remote! It's pretty small and find myself constantly digging for it in between the couch cushions. My original remote is still functioning but will stop working from time to time. I bought a replacement to be prepared for when it died!!. I almost thought i received a doa replacement as it took me several tries to get this to pair up! i followed the instructions verbatim several times with no luck. Even put in brand new batteries just in case the ones provided were dead, Nothing!!! Here is how i paired mine just in case anyone else is experiencing the same issue give these steps a try prior to filing a return.1 If your original is still working remove the batteries so it will go offline.2 Make sure replacement remote has new batteries (sometimes the ones provided are dead)3 Unplug the power to your fire box/stick (this will make it restart)4 Plug the power back in to your fire box/stick5 Wait for the home screen to load6 Hold down the home button on the replacement remote until it pairs up (this now forces the device to pair to the replacement remote as it is the only remote online)7 Once it pairs select the new remote from the list (done)8 You will notice your old remote is still paired but offline9 Now you can put the batteries back in the old remote and both remotes will work simultaneouslyHope this helps anyone having issues with the pairing process CHEERS!",4.0,B00NO8JJZW,1,all in all i love this remote it s pretty small and find myself constantly digging for it in between the couch cushions my original remote is still functioning but will stop working from time to time i bought a replacement to be prepared for when it died i almost thought i received a doa replacement as it took me several tries to get this to pair up i followed the instructions verbatim several times with no luck even put in brand new batteries just in case the ones provided were dead nothing here is how i paired mine just in case anyone else is experiencing the same issue give these steps a try prior to filing a return if your original is still working remove the batteries so it will go offline make sure replacement remote has new batteries sometimes the ones provided are dead unplug the power to your fire box stick this will make it restart plug the power back in to your fire box stick wait for the home screen to load hold down the home button on the replacement remote until it pairs up this now forces the device to pair to the replacement remote as it is the only remote online once it pairs select the new remote from the list done you will notice your old remote is still paired but offline now you can put the batteries back in the old remote and both remotes will work simultaneouslyhope this helps anyone having issues with the pairing process cheers
"I am now having to order my third remote because it randomly dies for no reason. Replacing batteries, attempting to resynch, etc... don't work.

"Don't bother paying for one or getting a replacement, it just isn't worth it.After so many of these things failed so many customers I thought Amazon would come up with a newer, better product but they have not yet.I have gone through three of these things and after the last one died I contacted customer support about it.The guy I spoke to said don't waist your money or your time anymore,upload the Amazon FireTV app on your tablet or phone, it will not fail you.It is not an exact duplicate of the remote face, but it works quite well with both Fire TV and Fire Stick.",2.0,B00NO8JJZW,0,don t bother paying for one or getting a replacement it just isn t worth it after so many of these things failed so many customers i thought amazon would come up with a newer better product but they have not yet i have gone through three of these things and after the last one died i contacted customer support about it the guy i spoke to said don t waist your money or your time anymore upload the amazon firetv app on your tablet or phone it will not fail you it is not an exact duplicate of the remote face but it works quite well with both fire tv and fire stick
"I've had the REPLACEMENT remote 3 months and it's stopped working. If I want to use my Amazon Fire TV (which I love) I have to use my cell phone or my tablet.

"Voice remote gave out nearly a year after I purchased. changed batteries several times and nothing. Have to rely on Phone App for it to function. Paid 19 for the stick when it was being promoted to Prime members. Now they want 30 , for an extra 10 might as well buy another Fire Stick, what a rip off for a hollow piece of plastic. Even with the Voice Remote feature, I still don't think it is worth it. Amazon should sell the remote for 10-15 dollars for Prime Members, we shouldn't have to worry if it fails outside of the warranty period. Amazon is already charging an arm and a leg for Prime Membership and its content to begin with.",1.0,B00NO8JJZW,0,voice remote gave out nearly a year after i purchased changed batteries several times and nothing have to rely on phone app for it to function paid for the stick when it was being promoted to prime members now they want for an extra might as well buy another fire stick what a rip off for a hollow piece of plastic even with the voice remote feature i still don t think it is worth it amazon should sell the remote for dollars for prime members we shouldn t have to worry if it fails outside of the warranty period amazon is already charging an arm and a leg for prime membership and its content to begin with

This is not the same remote that I got for my Alexa-Echo it doesn't control volume.... I think remotes most used feature is volume and pause. I would be disappointed with myself if i produced a remote that couldn't control volume. That would make me an incompetent engineer or lazy CEO!!!

"I have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since I purchased it in March. After the battery's short life span after the first battery replacement, we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller. It did not make a difference. It still drained the batteries just as quickly. I do have the option of using the phone app, and I do, but what if I'm not home and someone else wants to use the fire tv This is very, very poor quality product. Of course. It went out of warranty 12 days ago. I guess I should have been more mindful of that date. I do not recommend this product and I think Amazon should extend the warranty coverage. It is ridiculous that this remote basically doesn't work.",1.0,B00NO8JJZW,0,i have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since i purchased it in march after the battery s short life span after the first battery replacement we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller it did not make a difference it still drained the batteries just as quickly i do have the option of using the phone app and i do but what if i m not home and someone else wants to use the fire tv this is very very poor quality product of course it went out of warranty days ago i guess i should have been more mindful of that date i do not recommend this product and i think amazon should extend the warranty coverage it is ridiculous that this remote basically doesn t work

It does the job but is super over priced. I feel like they should offer a replacement remote at a better price. I could have just spent 10 more and gotten the stick. I just think it's ridiculous to spend 32 on a remote. The product is fine.

I ordered this item to replace the one that no longer works. The directions for the new remove state to press the home button to go to the home screen (using the existing remote which does not work) You must use your existing remote for all the following steps. The existing remote DOES NOT WORK. This is why I bought a new one. I am sending all of this crap back to amazon and canceling this Fire subscription. This has been a problem from day one and we have only had this for a few months.
